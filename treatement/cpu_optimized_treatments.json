    "psoriasis": [
        "Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role.",
        "There is no known cure for psoriasis, but various treatments can help control the symptoms.",
        "These treatments include steroid creams, vitamin D3 cream, ultraviolet light, immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate, and biologic therapies targeting specific immunologic pathways.",
        "There is no firm evidence regarding the best management for guttate psoriasis; however, first-line therapy for mild guttate psoriasis typically includes topical corticosteroids.",
        "Phototherapy can be used for moderate or severe guttate psoriasis.",
        "It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids.",
        "Genetics, seasonal changes, skin damage, climate, immunocompromised state, specific infections, and the use of some medications have been connected with different types of psoriasis.",
        "Genetic studies are valuable due to their ability to identify molecular mechanisms and pathways for further study and potential medication targets.",
        "It controls genes that affect the immune system or encode skin proteins that are overabundant with psoriasis.",
        "=== Medications === Drug-induced psoriasis may occur with beta blockers, lithium, antimalarial medications, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, terbinafine, calcium channel blockers, captopril, glyburide, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukins, interferons, lipid-lowering medications,: 197 and paradoxically TNF inhibitors such as infliximab or adalimumab.",
        "Withdrawal of corticosteroids (topical steroid cream) can aggravate psoriasis due to the rebound effect.",
        "The sequence of pathological events in psoriasis is thought to start with an initiation phase in which an event (skin trauma, infection, or drugs) leads to activation of the immune system and then the maintenance phase consisting of chronic progression of the disease.",
        "Skin cells are replaced every 3–5 days in psoriasis rather than the usual 28–30 days.",
        "Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) released from dying cells acts as an inflammatory stimulus in psoriasis and stimulates the receptors on certain dendritic cells, which in turn produce the cytokine interferon-α.",
        "They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1).",
        "Targeted immunotherapy, as well as psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, can reduce the number of dendritic cells and favors a TH2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile.",
        "Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17.",
        "Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.",
        "Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10.",
        "Similarly, it was found that there is an 11% reduction in aortic vascular inflammation when there is a 75% reduction in the PASI score.",
        "== Management == While no cure is available for psoriasis, many treatment options exist.",
        "Topical agents are typically used for mild disease, phototherapy for moderate disease, and systemic agents for severe disease.",
        "=== Topical agents === Topical corticosteroid preparations are the most effective agents when used continuously for eight weeks; retinoids and coal tar were found to be of limited benefit and may be no better than placebo.",
        "Very potent topical corticosteroids may be helpful in some cases, however, it is suggested to only use them for four weeks at a time and only if other less potent topical treatment options are not working.",
        "Vitamin D analogues (such as paricalcitol, calcipotriol, tacalcitol, and calcitriol) are superior to placebo.",
        "Combination therapy with vitamin D and a corticosteroid is superior to either treatment alone and vitamin D is superior to coal tar for chronic plaque psoriasis.",
        "For psoriasis of the scalp, a 2016 review found dual therapy (vitamin D analogs and topical corticosteroids) or corticosteroid monotherapy to be more effective and safer than topical vitamin D analogs alone.",
        "Due to their similar safety profiles and minimal benefit of dual therapy over monotherapy, corticosteroid monotherapy appears to be an acceptable treatment for short-term treatment.",
        "Moisturizers and emollients such as mineral oil, petroleum jelly, and decubal (an oil-in-water emollient) were found to increase the clearance of psoriatic plaques.",
        "Some emollients are even more effective at clearing psoriatic plaques when combined with phototherapy.",
        "Coconut oil, when used as an emollient in psoriasis, has been found to decrease plaque clearance with phototherapy.",
        "Medicated creams and ointments applied directly to psoriatic plaques can help reduce inflammation, remove built-up scale, reduce skin turnover, and clear affected skin of plaques.",
        "Ointment and creams containing coal tar, dithranol, corticosteroids (i.e. desoximetasone), fluocinonide, vitamin D3 analogues (for example, calcipotriol), and retinoids are routinely used.",
        "(The use of the finger tip unit may be helpful in guiding how much topical treatment to use.) Vitamin D analogs may be useful with steroids; steroids alone have a higher rate of side effects.",
        "Vitamin D analogs may allow lower doses of steroids to be used.",
        "Another topical therapy used to treat psoriasis is a form of balneotherapy, which involves daily baths in saltwater, such as the Dead Sea, combined with sun exposure.",
        "This is usually done for four weeks in which exposure time is gradually increased.",
        "This is cost-effective and it has been propagated as an effective way to treat psoriasis without medication.",
        "Decreases of PASI scores greater than 75% and remission for several months have commonly been observed.",
        "Data are inconclusive concerning nonmelanoma skin cancer risk, but support the idea that the therapy is associated with an increased risk of benign forms of sun-induced skin damage such as, but not limited to, actinic elastosis or liver spots.",
        "Tentative evidence indicates that balneophototherapy, a combination of salt bathes and exposure to ultraviolet B-light (UVB), in chronic plaque psoriasis is better than UVB alone.",
        "=== UV phototherapy === Phototherapy in the form of sunlight has long been used for psoriasis.",
        "The dose is increased in every treatment to let the skin get used to the light.",
        "Increased rates of cancer from treatment appear to be small.",
        "Narrowband UVB therapy has been demonstrated to have similar efficacy to psoralen and ultraviolet A phototherapy (PUVA).",
        "A 2013 meta-analysis found no difference in efficacy between NB-UVB and PUVA in the treatment of psoriasis, but NB-UVB is usually more convenient.",
        "One of the problems with clinical phototherapy is the difficulty many people have gaining access to a facility.",
        "Indoor tanning is already used by many people as a treatment for psoriasis; one indoor facility reported that 50% of its clients were using the center for psoriasis treatment; another reported 36% were doing the same thing.",
        "It does require more energy to reach erythemogenic dosing with UVA.",
        "UV light therapies all have risks; tanning beds are no exception, being listed by the World Health Organization as carcinogens.",
        "A review of studies recommends that people who are susceptible to skin cancers exercise caution when using UV light therapy as a treatment.",
        "This type of phototherapy is useful in the treatment of psoriasis because the formation of these dimers interferes with the cell cycle and stops it.",
        "The interruption of the cell cycle induced by NB-UVB opposes the characteristic rapid division of skin cells seen in psoriasis.",
        "The activity of many types of immune cells found in the skin is also effectively suppressed by NB-UVB phototherapy treatments.",
        "The most common short-term side effect of this form of phototherapy is redness of the skin; less common side effects of NB-UVB phototherapy are itching and blistering of the treated skin, irritation of the eyes in the form of conjunctival inflammation or inflammation of the cornea, or cold sores due to reactivation of the herpes simplex virus in the skin surrounding the lips.",
        "PUVA combines the oral or topical administration of psoralen with exposure to ultraviolet A (UVA) light.",
        "The mechanism of action of PUVA is unknown but probably involves activation of psoralen by UVA light, which inhibits the abnormally rapid production of the cells in psoriatic skin.",
        "PUVA is associated with nausea, headache, fatigue, burning, and itching.",
        "Long-term treatment is associated with squamous cell carcinoma (but not with melanoma).",
        "A combination therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis using PUVA plus acitretin resulted in benefit, but acitretin use has been associated with birth defects and liver damage.",
        "=== Systemic agents === Psoriasis resistant to topical treatment and phototherapy may be treated with systemic therapies including medications by mouth or injectable treatments.",
        "People undergoing systemic treatment must have regular blood and liver function tests to check for medication toxicities.",
        "The majority of people experience a recurrence of psoriasis after systemic treatment is discontinued.",
        "Non-biologic systemic treatments frequently used for psoriasis include methotrexate, ciclosporin, hydroxycarbamide, fumarates such as dimethyl fumarate, and retinoids.",
        "Methotrexate and ciclosporin are medications that suppress the immune system; retinoids are synthetic forms of vitamin A.",
        "These agents are also regarded as first-line treatments for psoriatic erythroderma.",
        "Oral corticosteroids should not be used as they can severely flare psoriasis upon their discontinuation.",
        "Biologics are manufactured proteins that interrupt the immune process involved in psoriasis.",
        "Unlike generalized immunosuppressive medical therapies such as methotrexate, biologics target specific aspects of the immune system contributing to psoriasis.",
        "These medications are generally well-tolerated, and limited long-term outcome data have demonstrated biologics to be safe for long-term use in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.",
        "However, due to their immunosuppressive actions, biologics have been associated with a small increase in the risk for infection.",
        "Guidelines regard biologics as a third-line treatment for plaque psoriasis following inadequate response to topical treatment, phototherapy, and non-biologic systemic treatments.",
        "European guidelines recommend avoiding biologics if a pregnancy is planned; anti-TNF therapies such as infliximab are not recommended for use in chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus or individuals infected with HIV.",
        "Several monoclonal antibodies target cytokines, the molecules that cells use to send inflammatory signals to each other.",
        "Four monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol) and one recombinant TNF-α decoy receptor, etanercept, have been developed to inhibit TNF-α signaling.",
        "Additional monoclonal antibodies, such as ixekizumab, have been developed against pro-inflammatory cytokines and inhibit the inflammatory pathway at a different point than the anti-TNF-α antibodies.",
        "IL-12 and IL-23 share a common domain, p40, which is the target of the FDA-approved ustekinumab.",
        "In 2017 the US FDA approved guselkumab for plaque psoriasis.",
        "There have been few studies of the efficacy of anti-TNF medications for psoriasis in children.",
        "One randomized control study suggested that 12 weeks of etanercept treatment reduced the extent of psoriasis in children with no lasting adverse effects.",
        "Two medications that target T cells are efalizumab and alefacept.",
        "Efalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the CD11a subunit of LFA-1.",
        "It also blocks the adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells that line blood vessels, which attract T cells.",
        "Efalizumab was voluntarily withdrawn from the European market in February 2009, and from the U.S. market in June 2009, by the manufacturer due to the medication's association with cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.",
        "Alefacept also blocks the molecules that dendritic cells use to communicate with T cells and even causes natural killer cells to kill T cells as a way of controlling inflammation.",
        "Neutralization occurs when an antidrug antibody prevents a monoclonal antibody such as infliximab from binding antigen in a laboratory test.",
        "Specifically, neutralization occurs when the anti-drug antibody binds to infliximab's antigen binding site instead of TNF-α.",
        "When infliximab no longer binds tumor necrosis factor alpha, it no longer decreases inflammation, and psoriasis may worsen.",
        "Neutralizing antibodies have not been reported against etanercept, a biologic medication that is a fusion protein composed of two TNF-α receptors.",
        "There is strong evidence to indicate that infliximab, bimekizumab, ixekizumab, and risankizumab are the most effective biologics for treating moderate to severe cases of psoriasis.",
        "There is also some evidence to support use of secukinumab, brodalumab, guselkumab, certolizumab, and ustekinumab.",
        "In general, anti-IL17, anti-IL12/23, anti-IL23, and anti-TNF alpha biologics were found to be more effective than traditional systemic treatments.",
        "Another set of treatments for moderate to severe psoriasis are fumaric acid esters (FAE), which may be similar in effectiveness to methotrexate.",
        "Apremilast (Otezla, Celgene) is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of the enzyme phosphodiesterase 4, which plays an important role in chronic inflammation associated with psoriasis.",
        "It has been theorized that antistreptococcal medications may improve guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis; however, limited studies do not show that antibiotics are effective.",
        "=== Surgery === Limited evidence suggests removal of the tonsils may benefit people with chronic plaque psoriasis, guttate psoriasis, and palmoplantar pustulosis.",
        "=== Diet === Uncontrolled studies have suggested that individuals with psoriasis or psoriatic arthritis may benefit from a diet supplemented with fish oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).",
        "A low-calorie diet appears to reduce the severity of psoriasis.",
        "Many patients report improvements after consuming less tobacco, caffeine, sugar, nightshades (tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, paprika and white potatoes) and taking probiotics and oral Vitamin D.",
        "When adopting a gluten-free diet, disease severity generally decreases in people with celiac disease and those with anti-gliadin antibodies.",
        "== Prognosis == Most people with psoriasis experience nothing more than mild skin lesions that can be treated effectively with topical therapies.",
        "Methotrexate may provide a degree of protection for the heart.",
        "Treating high levels of cholesterol with statins has been associated with decreased psoriasis severity, as measured by PASI score, and has also been associated with improvements in other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as markers of inflammation.",
        "These cardioprotective effects are attributed to ability of statins to improve blood lipid profile and because of their anti-inflammatory effects.",
        "Statin use in those with psoriasis and hyperlipidemia was associated with decreased levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and TNFα as well as decreased activity of the immune protein LFA-1.",
        "Psoriasis has been associated with a 16% increase in overall relative risk for non-skin cancer, thought to be attributed to systemic therapy, particularly methotrexate.",
        "People treated with long-term systemic therapy for psoriasis have a 52% increased risk cancers of the lung and bronchus, a 205% increase in the risk of developing cancers of the upper gastrointestinal tract, a 31% increase in the risk of developing cancers of the urinary tract, a 90% increase in the risk of developing liver cancer, and a 46% increase in the risk of developing pancreatic cancer.",
        "The person was deemed \"impure\" (see tumah and taharah) during their affected phase and is ultimately treated by the kohen.",
        "Admiral William Halsey missed out on the Battle of Midway because he contracted psoriasis while out at sea in the early months of American participation of World War II.",
        "Admiral Chester Nimitz medically ordered Halsey to recover at a hospital in Hawaii.",
        "In the 18th and 19th centuries, Fowler's solution, which contains a poisonous and carcinogenic arsenic compound, was used by dermatologists as a treatment for psoriasis.",
        "Mercury was also used for psoriasis treatment during this time.",
        "Sulfur, iodine, and phenol were also commonly used treatments for psoriasis during this era when it was incorrectly believed that psoriasis was an infectious disease.",
        "Coal tars were widely used with ultraviolet light irradiation as a topical treatment approach in the early 1900s.",
        "During the same time, psoriatic arthritis cases were treated with intravenously administered gold preparations in the same manner as rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "== Society and culture == The International Federation of Psoriasis Associations (IFPA) is the global umbrella organization for national and regional psoriasis associations and also gathers the leading experts in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis research for scientific conferences every three years.",
        "The Psoriasis International Network, a program of the Fondation René Touraine, gathers dermatologists, rheumatologists, and other caregivers involved in the management of psoriasis.",
        "=== Cost === The annual cost of treating psoriasis in the United States is estimated as high as $32.5 billion, including $12.2 billion in direct costs.",
        "Pharmacy costs are the main source of direct expense, with biologic therapy the most prevalent.",
        "These costs increase significantly when co-morbid conditions such as heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, lung disease, and psychiatric disorders are factored in.",
        "Preliminary research has suggested that antioxidants such as polyphenols may have beneficial effects on the inflammation characteristic of psoriasis.",
        "Many novel medications being researched during the 2010s target the Th17/IL-23 axis, particularly IL-23p19 inhibitors, as IL-23p19 is present in increased concentrations in psoriasis skin lesions while contributing less to protection against opportunistic infections.",
        "Other cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-22 also have been targets for inhibition as they play important roles in the pathogenesis of psoriasis.",
        "Another avenue of research has focused on the use of vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors to treat psoriasis.",
        "Oral agents being investigated during the 2010s as alternatives to medications administered by injection include Janus kinase inhibitors, protein kinase C inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors, and phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitors, all of which have proven effective in various phase 2 and 3 clinical trials.",
        "These agents have potentially severe side-effects due to their immunosuppressive mechanisms."

    "diabetes mellitus": [
        "The most common treatment for type 1 is insulin replacement therapy (insulin injections), while anti-diabetic medications (such as metformin and semaglutide) and lifestyle modifications can be used to manage type 2.",
        "Additionally, diabetes can also result from other specific causes, such as genetic conditions (monogenic diabetes syndromes like neonatal diabetes and maturity-onset diabetes of the young), diseases affecting the pancreas (such as pancreatitis), or the use of certain medications and chemicals (such as glucocorticoids, other specific drugs and after organ transplantation).",
        "The global expenditure on diabetes-related healthcare is an estimated US$760 billion a year.",
        "Hypoglycemia is a recognized complication of insulin treatment used in diabetes.",
        "Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of chronic kidney disease, accounting for over 50% of patients on dialysis in the United States.",
        "The condition also predisposes to falls in the elderly, especially those treated with insulin.",
        "The progression of prediabetes to overt type 2 diabetes can be slowed or reversed by lifestyle changes or medications that improve insulin sensitivity or reduce the liver's glucose production.",
        "Antipsychotic medication, SSRI, and SNRI side effects (specifically metabolic abnormalities, dyslipidemia and weight gain) are also potential risk factors.",
        "Gestational diabetes is fully treatable, but requires careful medical supervision throughout the pregnancy.",
        "Management may include dietary changes, blood glucose monitoring, and in some cases, insulin may be required.",
        "A caesarean section may be performed if there is marked fetal distress or an increased risk of injury associated with macrosomia, such as shoulder dystocia.",
        "People with MODY often can control it without using insulin.",
        "Many drugs impair insulin secretion and some toxins damage pancreatic beta cells, whereas others increase insulin resistance (especially glucocorticoids which can provoke \"steroid diabetes\").",
        "Insulin plays a critical role in regulating glucose levels in the body.",
        "Insulin can inhibit the breakdown of glycogen or the process of gluconeogenesis, it can stimulate the transport of glucose into fat and muscle cells, and it can stimulate the storage of glucose in the form of glycogen.",
        "Insulin is released into the blood by beta cells (β-cells), found in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, in response to rising levels of blood glucose, typically after eating.",
        "Insulin is used by about two-thirds of the body's cells to absorb glucose from the blood for use as fuel, for conversion to other needed molecules, or for storage.",
        "Lower glucose levels result in decreased insulin release from the beta cells and in the breakdown of glycogen to glucose.",
        "If the amount of insulin available is insufficient, or if cells respond poorly to the effects of insulin (insulin resistance), or if the insulin itself is defective, then glucose is not absorbed properly by the body cells that require it, and is not stored appropriately in the liver and muscles.",
        "This increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production (polyuria) and increased fluid loss.",
        "A positive result, in the absence of unequivocal high blood sugar, should be confirmed by a repeat of any of the above methods on a different day.",
        "Higher levels of physical activity (more than 90 minutes per day) reduce the risk of diabetes by 28%.",
        "Dietary changes known to be effective in helping to prevent diabetes include maintaining a diet rich in whole grains and fiber, and choosing good fats, such as the polyunsaturated fats found in nuts, vegetable oils, and fish.",
        "== Management == Diabetes management concentrates on keeping blood sugar levels close to normal, without causing low blood sugar.",
        "This can usually be accomplished with dietary changes, exercise, weight loss, and use of appropriate medications (insulin, oral medications).",
        "Learning about the disease and actively participating in the treatment is important, since complications are far less common and less severe in people who have well-managed blood sugar levels.",
        "The goal of treatment is an A1C level below 7%.",
        "Specialized footwear is widely used to reduce the risk of diabetic foot ulcers by relieving the pressure on the foot.",
        "=== Lifestyle === People with diabetes can benefit from education about the disease and treatment, dietary changes, and exercise, with the goal of keeping both short-term and long-term blood glucose levels within acceptable bounds.",
        "Weight loss can prevent progression from prediabetes to diabetes type 2, decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease, or result in a partial remission in people with diabetes.",
        "According to the ADA, \"reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia\", and for individuals with type 2 diabetes who cannot meet the glycemic targets or where reducing anti-glycemic medications is a priority, low or very-low carbohydrate diets are a viable approach.",
        "For overweight people with type 2 diabetes, any diet that achieves weight loss is effective.",
        "Early recognition, screening, treatment, and education of diabetic children are needed to prevent long-term disease complications.",
        "==== Treatment and management ==== Adoption of healthy lifestyle practices and metformin medication are recommended as initial treatments.",
        "Metformin at 500 mg per day is used upon diagnosis.",
        "Insulin is used for children with a blood glucose of more than 250 mg per dl and a hemoglobin A1c greater than 8.5%.",
        "A health care team may include a pediatric endocrinologist or physician trained in pediatric diabetes, a diabetes specialist nurse, a registered dietitian, a psychologist, a social worker, and child life specialist.",
        "=== Medications === ==== Glucose control ==== Most medications used to treat diabetes act by lowering blood sugar levels through different mechanisms.",
        "There is broad consensus that when people with diabetes maintain tight glucose control – keeping the glucose levels in their blood within normal ranges – they experience fewer complications, such as kidney problems or eye problems.",
        "There is, however, debate as to whether this is appropriate and cost effective for people later in life in whom the risk of hypoglycemia may be more significant.",
        "There are a number of different classes of anti-diabetic medications.",
        "Type 1 diabetes requires treatment with insulin, ideally using a \"basal bolus\" regimen that most closely matches normal insulin release: long-acting insulin for the basal rate and short-acting insulin with meals.",
        "Type 2 diabetes is generally treated with medication that is taken by mouth (e.g. metformin) although some eventually require injectable treatment with insulin or GLP-1 agonists.",
        "Metformin is generally recommended as a first-line treatment for type 2 diabetes, as there is good evidence that it decreases mortality.",
        "It works by decreasing the liver's production of glucose, and increasing the amount of glucose stored in peripheral tissue.",
        "Several other groups of drugs, mainly oral medication, may also decrease blood sugar in type 2 diabetes.",
        "These include agents that increase insulin release (sulfonylureas), agents that decrease absorption of sugar from the intestines (acarbose), agents that inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) that inactivates incretins such as GLP-1 and GIP (sitagliptin), agents that make the body more sensitive to insulin (thiazolidinedione) and agents that increase the excretion of glucose in the urine (SGLT2 inhibitors).",
        "When insulin is used in type 2 diabetes, a long-acting formulation is usually added initially, while continuing oral medications.",
        "Some severe cases of type 2 diabetes may also be treated with insulin, which is increased gradually until glucose targets are reached.",
        "==== Blood pressure lowering ==== Cardiovascular disease is a serious complication associated with diabetes, and many international guidelines recommend blood pressure treatment targets that are lower than 140/90 mmHg for people with diabetes.",
        "A 2016 systematic review found potential harm to treating to targets lower than 140 mmHg, and a subsequent systematic review in 2019 found no evidence of additional benefit from blood pressure lowering to between 130 – 140mmHg, although there was an increased risk of adverse events.",
        "2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations are that people with diabetes and albuminuria should receive an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system to reduce the risks of progression to end-stage renal disease, cardiovascular events, and death.",
        "There is some evidence that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are superior to other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system such as angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or aliskiren in preventing cardiovascular disease.",
        "Although a more recent review found similar effects of ACEIs and ARBs on major cardiovascular and renal outcomes.",
        "==== Aspirin ==== The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease in diabetes is controversial.",
        "Aspirin is recommended by some in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease; however, routine use of aspirin has not been found to improve outcomes in uncomplicated diabetes.",
        "2015 American Diabetes Association recommendations for aspirin use (based on expert consensus or clinical experience) are that low-dose aspirin use is reasonable in adults with diabetes who are at intermediate risk of cardiovascular disease (10-year cardiovascular disease risk, 5–10%).",
        "National guidelines for England and Wales by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommend against the use of aspirin in people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who do not have confirmed cardiovascular disease.",
        "=== Surgery === Weight loss surgery in those with obesity and type 2 diabetes is often an effective measure.",
        "Many are able to maintain normal blood sugar levels with little or no medications following surgery and long-term mortality is decreased.",
        "It is recommended that this option be considered in those who are unable to get both their weight and blood sugar under control.",
        "A pancreas transplant is occasionally considered for people with type 1 diabetes who have severe complications of their disease, including end stage kidney disease requiring kidney transplantation.",
        "When DPN is superimposed with nerve compression, DPN may be treatable with multiple nerve decompressions.",
        "The theory is that DPN predisposes peripheral nerves to compression at anatomical sites of narrowing, and that the majority of DPN symptoms are actually attributable to nerve compression, a treatable condition, rather than DPN itself.",
        "The surgery is associated with lower pain scores, higher two-point discrimination (a measure of sensory improvement), lower rate of ulcerations, fewer falls (in the case of lower extremity decompression), and fewer amputations.",
        "=== Self-management and support === In countries using a general practitioner system, such as the United Kingdom, care may take place mainly outside hospitals, with hospital-based specialist care used only in case of complications, difficult blood sugar control, or research projects.",
        "Evidence has shown that social prescribing led to slight improvements in blood sugar control for people with type 2 diabetes.",
        "The use of technology to deliver educational programs for adults with type 2 diabetes includes computer-based self-management interventions to collect for tailored responses to facilitate self-management.",
        "1500 BCE mentioning \"too great emptying of the urine.\" The Ebers papyrus includes a recommendation for a drink to take in such cases.",
        "Effective treatment was not developed until the early part of the 20th century when Canadians Frederick Banting and Charles Best isolated and purified insulin in 1921 and 1922.",
        "This was followed by the development of the long-acting insulin NPH in the 1940s.",
        "=== Etymology === The word diabetes ( or ) comes from Latin diabētēs, which in turn comes from Ancient Greek διαβήτης (diabētēs), which literally means \"a passer through; a siphon\".",
        "The word \"diabetes\" is first recorded in English, in the form diabete, in a medical text written around 1425.",
        "Several countries established more and less successful national diabetes programmes to improve treatment of the disease.",
        "The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans."

    "asthma": [
        "Other potential triggers include medications such as aspirin and beta blockers.",
        "Diagnosis is usually based on the pattern of symptoms, response to therapy over time, and spirometry lung function testing.",
        "There is no known cure for asthma, but it can be controlled.",
        "Symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers, such as allergens and respiratory irritants, and suppressed with the use of inhaled corticosteroids.",
        "Long-acting beta agonists (LABA) or antileukotriene agents may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if asthma symptoms remain uncontrolled.",
        "Treatment of rapidly worsening symptoms is usually with an inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist such as salbutamol and corticosteroids taken by mouth.",
        "In very severe cases, intravenous corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, and hospitalization may be required.",
        "These medications may also decrease the risk of dental erosions.",
        "These influence both its severity and its responsiveness to treatment.",
        "==== Pregnancy ==== The evidence does not support a causal role between paracetamol (acetaminophen) or antibiotic use and asthma.",
        "A 2014 systematic review found that the association between paracetamol use and asthma disappeared when respiratory infections were taken into account.",
        "Use of antibiotics in early life has been linked to the development of asthma.",
        "Beta blocker medications such as propranolol can trigger asthma in those who are susceptible.",
        "Cardioselective beta-blockers, however, appear safe in those with mild or moderate disease.",
        "Other medications that can cause problems in asthmatics are angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and NSAIDs. Use of acid-suppressing medication (proton pump inhibitors and H2 blockers) during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of asthma in the child.",
        "There is limited evidence to guide possible approaches to reducing autumn exacerbations, but while costly, seasonal omalizumab treatment from four to six weeks before school return may reduce autumn asthma exacerbations.",
        "These episodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction within the lung that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment\".",
        "There is currently no precise test for the diagnosis, which is typically based on the pattern of symptoms and response to therapy over time.",
        "If the FEV1 measured by this technique improves more than 12% and increases by at least 200 millilitres following administration of a bronchodilator such as salbutamol, this is supportive of the diagnosis.",
        "As caffeine is a bronchodilator in people with asthma, the use of caffeine before a lung function test may interfere with the results.",
        "It is reasonable to perform spirometry every one or two years to follow how well a person's asthma is controlled.",
        "Other supportive evidence includes: a ≥20% difference in peak expiratory flow rate on at least three days in a week for at least two weeks, a ≥20% improvement of peak flow following treatment with either salbutamol, inhaled corticosteroids or prednisone, or a ≥20% decrease in peak flow following exposure to a trigger.",
        "It may be useful for daily self-monitoring in those with moderate to severe disease and for checking the effectiveness of new medications.",
        "It may also be helpful in guiding treatment in those with acute exacerbations.",
        "Finding ways to identify subgroups that respond well to different types of treatments is a current critical goal of asthma research.",
        "This approach to immunologic classification is driven by a developing understanding of the underlying immune processes and by the development of therapeutic approaches that target type 2 inflammation.",
        "Acute severe asthma, previously known as status asthmaticus, is an acute exacerbation of asthma that does not respond to standard treatments of bronchodilators and corticosteroids.",
        "Half of cases are due to infections with others caused by allergen, air pollution, or insufficient or inappropriate medication use.",
        "Type 1 brittle asthma is a disease with wide peak flow variability, despite intense medication.",
        "Inhaled beta2 agonists do not appear to improve athletic performance among those without asthma; however, oral doses may improve endurance and strength.",
        "==== Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease ==== Aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD), also known as aspirin-induced asthma, affects up to 9% of asthmatics.",
        "AERD consists of asthma, nasal polyps, sinus disease, and respiratory reactions to aspirin and other NSAID medications (such as ibuprofen and naproxen).",
        "This may be even more common in some ethnic groups, such as the Japanese and those with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.",
        "Other studies have found improvement in asthmatic symptoms from alcohol.",
        "Reported clinical prevalences of IA for adults range from around 40% in a primary care practice to 70% in a speciality practice treating mainly severe asthma patients.",
        "Classification based on type 2 inflammation is useful in predicting which patients will benefit from targeted biologic therapy.",
        "In adults, COPD, congestive heart failure, airway masses, as well as drug-induced coughing due to ACE inhibitors may cause similar symptoms.",
        "However, this level of investigation is not performed due to COPD and asthma sharing similar principles of management: corticosteroids, long-acting beta-agonists, and smoking cessation.",
        "It closely resembles asthma in symptoms, is correlated with more exposure to cigarette smoke, an older age, less symptom reversibility after bronchodilator administration, and decreased likelihood of family history of atopy.",
        "Reducing or eliminating compounds known to provoke sensitive people from the workplace may be effective.",
        "== Management == While there is no cure for asthma, symptoms can typically be improved.",
        "The most effective treatment for asthma is identifying triggers, such as cigarette smoke, use of electronic cigarettes, pets or other allergens, and eliminating exposure to them.",
        "If trigger avoidance is insufficient, the use of medication is recommended.",
        "Pharmaceutical drugs are selected based on, among other things, the severity of illness and the frequency of symptoms.",
        "Specific medications for asthma are broadly classified into fast-acting and long-acting categories.",
        "The medications listed below have demonstrated efficacy in improving asthma symptoms; however, real world use-effectiveness is limited as around half of people with asthma worldwide remain sub-optimally controlled, even when treated.",
        "People with asthma may remain sub-optimally controlled either because optimum doses of asthma medications do not work (called \"refractory\" asthma) or because individuals are either unable (e.g. inability to afford treatment, poor inhaler technique) or unwilling (e.g., wish to avoid side effects of corticosteroids) to take optimum doses of prescribed asthma medications (called \"difficult to treat\" asthma).",
        "In practice, it is not possible to distinguish \"refractory\" from \"difficult to treat\" categories for patients who have never taken optimum doses of asthma medications.",
        "For example, asthma efficacy treatment trials always exclude otherwise eligible people who smoke, and smoking diminishes the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids, the mainstay of asthma control management.",
        "If mild persistent disease is present (more than two attacks a week), low-dose inhaled corticosteroids or alternatively, a leukotriene antagonist or a mast cell stabilizer by mouth is recommended.",
        "For those who have daily attacks, a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids is used.",
        "In a moderate or severe exacerbation, corticosteroids by mouth are added to these treatments.",
        "Cognitive behavioural therapy may improve quality of life, asthma control, and anxiety levels in people with asthma.",
        "School-based asthma self-management interventions, which attempt to improve knowledge of asthma, its triggers, and the importance of regular practitioner review, may reduce hospital admissions and emergency department visits.",
        "These interventions may also reduce the number of days children experience asthma symptoms and may lead to small improvements in asthma-related quality of life.",
        "Some people with asthma use pulse oximeters to monitor their own blood oxygen levels during an asthma attack.",
        "Laws that limit smoking decrease the number of people hospitalized for asthma.",
        "Yoga could provide small improvements in quality of life and symptoms in people with asthma.",
        "Findings suggest that the Wim Hof Method may reduce inflammation in healthy and non-healthy participants as it increases epinephrine levels, causing an increase in interleukin-10 and a decrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines.",
        "=== Medications === Medications used to treat asthma are divided into two general classes: quick-relief medications used to treat acute symptoms, and long-term control medications used to prevent further exacerbation.",
        "==== Medications for asthma exacerbations ==== Short-acting beta2-adrenoceptor agonists (SABAs), such as salbutamol (albuterol USAN) are the first-line treatment for asthma symptoms.",
        "Anticholinergic medications, such as ipratropium, provide additional benefit when used in combination with SABA in those with moderate or severe symptoms and may prevent hospitalizations.",
        "Anticholinergic bronchodilators can also be used if a person cannot tolerate a SABA.",
        "For children over 2 years old with acute asthma symptoms, inhaled anticholinergic medications taken alone is safe but is not as effective as inhaled SABA or SABA combined with inhaled anticholinergic medication.",
        "Adults who receive combined inhaled medications, which include short-acting anticholinergics and SABA, may be at risk for increased adverse effects such as experiencing a tremor, agitation, and heart beat palpitations compared to people who are treated with SABAs alone.",
        "Older, less selective adrenergic agonists, such as inhaled epinephrine, have similar efficacy to SABAs. They are, however, not recommended due to concerns regarding excessive cardiac stimulation.",
        "Corticosteroids can also help with the acute phase of an exacerbation because of their antiinflammatory properties.",
        "The benefit of systemic and oral corticosteroids is well established.",
        "For adults and children who are in the hospital due to acute asthma, systemic (IV) corticosteroids improve symptoms.",
        "A short course of corticosteroids after an acute asthma exacerbation may help prevent relapses and reduce hospitalizations.",
        "Intravenous administration of the drug aminophylline does not provide an improvement in bronchodilation when compared to standard inhaled beta2 agonist treatment.",
        "Aminophylline treatment is associated with more adverse effects compared to inhaled beta2 agonist treatment.",
        "==== Long–term control ==== Corticosteroids are generally considered the most effective treatment available for long-term control.",
        "Inhaled forms are usually used except in the case of severe persistent disease, in which oral corticosteroids may be needed.",
        "High dosage and long-term use might lead to the appearance of common adverse effects which are growth delay, adrenal suppression, and osteoporosis.",
        "Continuous (daily) use of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than its intermitted use, seems to provide better results in controlling asthma exacerbations.",
        "Long-acting beta-adrenoceptor agonists (LABA) such as salmeterol and formoterol can improve asthma control, at least in adults, when given in combination with inhaled corticosteroids.",
        "When used without steroids they increase the risk of severe side-effects, and with corticosteroids they may slightly increase the risk.",
        "Evidence suggests that for children who have persistent asthma, a treatment regime that includes LABA added to inhaled corticosteroids may improve lung function but does not reduce the amount of serious exacerbations.",
        "Children who require LABA as part of their asthma treatment may need to go to the hospital more frequently.",
        "Leukotriene receptor antagonists (anti-leukotriene agents such as montelukast and zafirlukast) may be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, typically also in conjunction with a LABA.",
        "For adults or adolescents who have persistent asthma that is not controlled very well, the addition of anti-leukotriene agents along with daily inhaled corticosteriods improves lung function and reduces the risk of moderate and severe asthma exacerbations.",
        "Anti-leukotriene agents may be effective alone for adolescents and adults; however, there is no clear research suggesting which people with asthma would benefit from anti-leukotriene receptor alone.",
        "In those under five years of age, anti-leukotriene agents were the preferred add-on therapy after inhaled corticosteroids.",
        "A 2013 Cochrane systematic review concluded that anti-leukotriene agents appear to be of little benefit when added to inhaled steroids for treating children.",
        "A similar class of drugs, 5-LOX inhibitors, may be used as an alternative in the chronic treatment of mild to moderate asthma among older children and adults.",
        "As of 2013 there is one medication in this family known as zileuton.",
        "Mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn sodium) are safe alternatives to corticosteroids but not preferred because they have to be administered frequently.",
        "Oral theophyllines are sometimes used for controlling chronic asthma, but their use is minimized due to side effects.",
        "Omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody against IgE, is a novel way to lessen exacerbations by decreasing the levels of circulating IgE that play a significant role in allergic asthma.",
        "Anticholinergic medications such as ipratropium bromide are not beneficial for treating chronic asthma in children over 2 years old, and are not suggested for routine treatment of chronic asthma in adults.",
        "Methotrexate is not suggested as a replacement for taking corticosteroids by mouth (\"steroid-sparing\") due to the adverse effects associated with taking methotrexate and the minimal relief provided for asthma symptoms.",
        "Macrolide antibiotics, particularly the azalide macrolide azithromycin, are a recently added Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA)-recommended treatment option for both eosinophilic and non-eosinophilic severe, refractory asthma based on azithromycin's efficacy in reducing moderate and severe exacerbations combined.",
        "Azithromycin's mechanism of action is not established, and could involve pathogen- and/or host-directed anti-inflammatory activities.",
        "Limited clinical observations suggest that some patients with new-onset asthma and with \"difficult-to-treat\" asthma (including those with the asthma-COPD overlap syndrome – ACOS) may respond dramatically to azithromycin.",
        "A 2024 study indicates that commonly used diabetes medications may lower asthma attacks by up to 70%.",
        "The research examined metformin and GLP-1 drugs such as Ozempic (semaglutide), Mounjaro (tirzepatide), and Saxenda (liraglutide).",
        "Among nearly 13,000 participants with both diabetes and asthma, metformin reduced the risk of asthma attacks by 30%, with an additional 40% reduction when combined with a GLP-1 drug.",
        "For children with asthma that is well-controlled on combination therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta2-agonists (LABA), the benefits and harms of stopping LABA and stepping down to ICS-only therapy are uncertain.",
        "In adults who have stable asthma while they are taking a combination of LABA and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), stopping LABA may increase the risk of asthma exacerbations that require treatment with corticosteroids by mouth.",
        "Stopping LABA probably makes little or no important difference to asthma control or asthma-related quality of life.",
        "Whether or not stopping LABA increases the risk of serious adverse events or exacerbations requiring an emergency department visit or hospitalization is uncertain.",
        "==== Delivery methods ==== Medications are typically provided as metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) in combination with an inhaler spacer or as a dry powder inhaler.",
        "The spacer is a plastic cylinder that mixes the medication with air, making it easier to receive a full dose of the drug.",
        "Nebulizers and spacers are equally effective in those with mild to moderate symptoms.",
        "For delivering short-acting beta-agonists in acute asthma in children, spacers may have advantages compared to nebulisers, but children with life-threatening asthma have not been studied.",
        "There is insufficient evidence to directly compare the effectiveness of a metered-dose inhaler attached to a homemade spacer compared to a commercially available spacer for treating children with asthma.",
        "==== Adverse effects ==== Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids at conventional doses carries a minor risk of adverse effects.",
        "Rinsing the mouth after the use of inhaled steroids can decrease the risk of thrush.",
        "Higher doses of inhaled steroids may result in lower bone mineral density.",
        "The use of exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO) to guide asthma medication dosing may have small benefits for preventing asthma attacks but the potential benefits are not strong enough for this approach to be universally recommended as a method to guide asthma therapy in adults or children.",
        "Corticosteroids by mouth, with five days of prednisone being the same two days of dexamethasone.",
        "Magnesium sulfate intravenous treatment increases bronchodilation when used in addition to other treatment in moderate to severe acute asthma attacks.",
        "In adults, intravenous treatment results in a reduction of hospital admissions.",
        "Low levels of evidence suggest that inhaled (nebulized) magnesium sulfate may have a small benefit for treating acute asthma in adults.",
        "Overall, high-quality evidence do not indicate a large benefit for combining magnesium sulfate with standard inhaled treatments for adults with asthma.",
        "Intravenous salbutamol is not supported by available evidence and is thus used only in extreme cases.",
        "Methylxanthines (such as theophylline) were once widely used, but do not add significantly to the effects of inhaled beta-agonists.",
        "A 2012 Cochrane review found no significant benefit from the use of ketamine in severe acute asthma in children.",
        "For those with severe, persistent asthma not controlled by inhaled corticosteroids and LABAs, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option.",
        "It involves the delivery of controlled thermal energy to the airway wall during a series of bronchoscopies.",
        "Monoclonal antibody injections such as mepolizumab, dupilumab, or omalizumab may be useful in those with poorly controlled atopic asthma.",
        "However, as of 2019 these medications are expensive and their use is therefore reserved for those with severe symptoms to achieve cost-effectiveness.",
        "Monoclonal antibodies targeting interleukin-5 (IL-5) or its receptor (IL-5R), including mepolizumab, reslizumab or benralizumab, in addition to standard care in severe asthma is effective in reducing the rate of asthma exacerbations.",
        "Evidence suggests that sublingual immunotherapy in those with both allergic rhinitis and asthma improve outcomes.",
        "=== Adherence to asthma treatments === Staying with a treatment approach for preventing asthma exacerbations can be challenging, especially if the person is required to take medicine or treatments daily.",
        "Reasons for low adherence range from a conscious decision to not follow the suggested medical treatment regime for various reasons including avoiding potential side effects, misinformation, or other beliefs about the medication.",
        "Problems accessing the treatment and problems administering the treatment effectively can also result in lower adherence.",
        "Various approaches have been undertaken to try and improve adherence to treatments to help people prevent serious asthma exacerbations, including digital interventions.",
        "=== Alternative medicine === Many people with asthma, like those with other chronic disorders, use alternative treatments; surveys show that roughly 50% use some form of unconventional therapy.",
        "There is little data to support the effectiveness of most of these therapies.",
        "There is tentative support for use of vitamin C in exercise induced bronchospasm.",
        "In people with mild to moderate asthma, treatment with vitamin D supplementation or its hydroxylated metabolites does not reduce acute exacerbations or improve control.",
        "Acupuncture is not recommended for the treatment as there is insufficient evidence to support its use.",
        "Pulmonary rehabilitation, however, may improve quality of life and functional exercise capacity when compared to usual care for adults with asthma.",
        "The Buteyko breathing technique for controlling hyperventilation may result in a reduction in medication use; however, the technique does not have any effect on lung function.",
        "Mortality has decreased over the last few decades due to better recognition and improvement in care.",
        "Early treatment with corticosteroids seems to prevent or ameliorate a decline in lung function.",
        "As of 2016, the prevalence of asthma was highest in non-Hispanic black and Puerto Rican children.",
        "== History == Asthma was recognized in ancient Egypt and was treated by drinking an incense mixture known as kyphi.",
        "In the 12th century the Jewish physician-philosopher Maimonides wrote a treatise on asthma in Arabic, based partly on Arabic sources, in which he discussed the symptoms, proposed various dietary and other means of treatment, and emphasized the importance of climate and clean air.",
        "Traditional Chinese medicine also offered medication for asthma, as indicated by a surviving 14th-century manuscript curated by the Wellcome Foundation.",
        "In 1873, one of the first papers in modern medicine on the subject tried to explain the pathophysiology of the disease while one in 1872, concluded that asthma can be cured by rubbing the chest with chloroform liniment.",
        "Medical treatment in 1880 included the use of intravenous doses of a drug called pilocarpine.",
        "At the beginning of the 20th century, the focus was on the avoidance of allergens as well as the use of selective beta-2 adrenoceptor agonists as treatment strategies.",
        "Epinephrine was first referred to in the treatment of asthma in 1905.",
        "Oral corticosteroids began to be used for the condition in 1950.",
        "The use of a pressurized metered-dose inhaler was developed in the mid-1950s for the administration of adrenaline and isoproterenol and was later used as a beta2-adrenergic agonist.",
        "Inhaled corticosteroids and selective short-acting beta agonists came into wide use in the 1960s.",
        "Roosevelt's youth was in large part shaped by his poor health, partly related to his asthma.",
        "Its cause was considered to be psychological, with treatment often based on psychoanalysis and other talking cures.",
        "As these psychoanalysts interpreted the asthmatic wheeze as the suppressed cry of the child for its mother, they considered the treatment of depression to be especially important for individuals with asthma.",
        "Additionally, New Zealand experienced a major epidemic of asthma in this period, which may have been due to inadequate maintenance therapy and long-term management of the disease amongst those affected, as well as delays in receiving care in emergencies.",

        "Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications.",
        "If lifestyle changes are not sufficient, blood pressure medications are used.",
        "Up to three medications taken concurrently can control blood pressure in 90% of people.",
        "The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure (defined as >160/100 mmHg) with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy.",
        "The effect of treatment of blood pressure between 130/80 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg is less clear, with some reviews finding benefitand others finding unclear benefit.",
        "In these cases, oral medications are used to lower blood pressure over 24 to 48 hours gradually.",
        "In a hypertensive emergency, the blood pressure must be reduced more rapidly to stop ongoing organ damage; however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trial evidence for this approach.",
        "There have been significant findings on how exercising can help reduce the effects of hypertension just after one bout of exercise.",
        "Through regular bouts of physical activity, blood pressure can be reduced and lower the incidence of hypertension.",

        "The blood pressure cuff should be deflated slowly (2–3 mmHg per second) while listening for the Korotkoff sounds.",
        "In the United Kingdom, the current best practice is to follow up a single raised clinic reading with ambulatory measurement, or, less ideally, with home blood pressure monitoring over 7 days.",
        "eGFR can also provide a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain anti-hypertensive drugs on kidney function.",
        "Consequently, population strategies are required to reduce the consequences of high blood pressure and reduce the need for antihypertensive medications.",
        "Recommended lifestyle changes for the prevention of hypertension include: maintain normal body weight for adults (e.g. body mass index below 25 kg/m2) reduce dietary sodium intake to <100 mmol/day (<6 g of salt (sodium chloride) or <2.4 g of sodium per day) engage in regular aerobic physical activity with moderate intensity (minimum 150 minutes per week) limit alcohol consumption, max 1 drink for women and 2 for men per day consume a diet rich in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, such as the DASH diet not smoking stress reduction and management, e.g. by meditation and yoga Effective lifestyle modification may lower blood pressure as much as an individual antihypertensive medication.",
        "Consequently, in the absence of results from randomized controlled trials, the wisdom of reducing levels of dietary sodium intake below 3 g/day has been questioned.",
        "== Management == According to one review published in 2003, reduction of the blood pressure by 5 mmHg can decrease the risk of stroke by 34%, of ischemic heart disease by 21%, and reduce the likelihood of dementia, heart failure, and mortality from cardiovascular disease.",
        "=== Target blood pressure === Various expert groups have produced guidelines regarding how low the blood pressure target should be when a person is treated for hypertension.",
        "Cochrane reviews recommend similar targets for subgroups such as people with diabetes and people with prior cardiovascular disease.",
        "Many expert groups recommend a slightly higher target of 150/90 mmHg for those somewhere between 60 and 80 years of age.",
        "The JNC 8 and American College of Physicians recommend the target of 150/90 mmHg for those over 60 years of age, but some experts within these groups disagree with this recommendation.",
        "The issue of what is the best target and whether targets should differ for high-risk individuals is unresolved, although some experts propose more intensive blood pressure lowering than advocated in some guidelines.",
        "Though these have all been recommended in scientific advisories, a Cochrane systematic review found no evidence (due to lack of data) for effects of weight loss diets on death, long-term complications or adverse events in persons with hypertension.",
        "The review did find a decrease in body weight and blood pressure.",
        "Their potential effectiveness is similar to and at times exceeds a single medication.",
        "Dietary changes shown to reduce blood pressure include diets with low sodium, the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), which was the best against 11 other diet in an umbrella review, and plant-based diets.",
        "A 2024 clinical guideline recommended an increase dietary fiber intake, with a minimum of 28g/day for women and 38g/day for men diagnosed with hypertension.",
        "Increasing dietary potassium has a potential benefit for lowering the risk of hypertension.",
        "However, people who take certain antihypertensive medications (such as ACE-inhibitors or ARBs) should not take potassium supplements or potassium-enriched salts due to the risk of high levels of potassium.",
        "Physical exercise regimens which are shown to reduce blood pressure include isometric resistance exercise, aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and device-guided breathing.",
        "A 2020 Cochrane review examined the impact of walking on blood pressure and heart rate in adults.",
        "The review found that walking likely reduces systolic blood pressure, with consistent effects across different age groups and both sexes.",
        "Stress reduction techniques such as biofeedback or transcendental meditation may be considered as an add-on to other treatments to reduce hypertension, but do not have evidence for preventing cardiovascular disease on their own.",
        "=== Medications === Several classes of medications, collectively referred to as antihypertensive medications, are available for treating hypertension.",
        "First-line medications for hypertension include thiazide-diuretics, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).",
        "These medications may be used alone or in combination (ACE inhibitors and ARBs are not recommended for use together); the latter option may serve to minimize counter-regulatory mechanisms that act to restore blood pressure values to pre-treatment levels, although the evidence for first-line combination therapy is not strong enough.",
        "Most people require more than one medication to control their hypertension.",
        "Medications for blood pressure control should be implemented by a stepped care approach when target levels are not reached.",
        "Withdrawal of such medications in the elderly can be considered by healthcare professionals, because there is no strong evidence of an effect on mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke.",
        "Previously, beta-blockers such as atenolol were thought to have similar beneficial effects when used as first-line therapy for hypertension.",
        "However, a Cochrane review that included 13 trials found that the effects of beta-blockers are inferior to those of other antihypertensive medications in preventing cardiovascular disease.",
        "The prescription of antihypertensive medication for children with hypertension has limited evidence.",
        "Administration of a higher dose did not reduce blood pressure further.",
        "=== Resistant hypertension === Resistant hypertension is defined as high blood pressure that remains above a target level, despite being prescribed three or more antihypertensive drugs simultaneously with different mechanisms of action.",
        "Failing to take prescribed medications as directed is an important cause of resistant hypertension.",
        "As many as one in five people with resistant hypertension have primary aldosteronism, which is a treatable and sometimes curable condition.",
        "Electrical therapies that stimulate the baroreflex are being studied as an option for lowering blood pressure in people in this situation.",
        "Refractory hypertension is described by one source as elevated blood pressure unmitigated by five or more concurrent antihypertensive agents of different classes.",
        "In 1995, it was estimated that 24% of the United States population had hypertension or were taking antihypertensive medication.",
        "In 2017, with the American guidelines' change in definition for hypertension, 46% of people in the United States are affected.",
        "However, hypertension as a clinical entity came into its own with the invention of the cuff-based sphygmomanometer by Scipione Riva-Rocci in 1896.",
        "This allowed easy measurement of systolic pressure in the clinic.",
        "=== Treatment === Historically, the treatment for what was called the \"hard pulse disease\" consisted of reducing the quantity of blood by bloodletting or the application of leeches.",
        "This was advocated by The Yellow Emperor of China, Cornelius Celsus, Galen, and Hippocrates.",
        "The therapeutic approach for the treatment of hard pulse disease included lifestyle changes (staying away from anger and sexual intercourse) and dietary program for patients (avoiding the consumption of wine, meat, and pastries, reducing the volume of food in a meal, maintaining a low-energy diet and the dietary usage of spinach and vinegar).",
        "In the 19th and 20th centuries, before effective pharmacological treatment for hypertension became possible, three treatment modalities were used, all with numerous side effects: strict sodium restriction (for example the rice diet), sympathectomy (surgical ablation of parts of the sympathetic nervous system), and pyrogen therapy (injection of substances that caused a fever, indirectly reducing blood pressure).",
        "The first chemical for hypertension, sodium thiocyanate, was used in 1900 but had many side effects and was unpopular.",
        "Several other agents were developed after the Second World War, the most popular and reasonably effective of which were tetramethylammonium chloride, hexamethonium, hydralazine, and reserpine (derived from the medicinal plant Rauvolfia serpentina).",
        "A major breakthrough was achieved with the discovery of the first well-tolerated orally available agents.",
        "The first was chlorothiazide, the first thiazide diuretic and developed from the antibiotic sulfanilamide, which became available in 1958.",
        "Subsequently, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and renin inhibitors were developed as antihypertensive agents.",
        "In the US 80% of people with hypertension are aware of their condition, 71% take some antihypertensive medication, but only 48% of people aware that they have hypertension adequately control it.",
        "Health care providers face many obstacles to achieving blood pressure control, including resistance to taking multiple medications to reach blood pressure goals.",
        "People also face the challenges of adhering to medical schedules and making lifestyle changes.",
        "Nonetheless, the achievement of blood pressure goals is possible, and most importantly, lowering blood pressure significantly reduces the risk of death due to heart disease and stroke, the development of other debilitating conditions, and the cost associated with advanced medical care.",
        "== Other animals == Hypertension in cats is indicated by a systolic blood pressure greater than 150 mmHg, with amlodipine the usual first-line treatment.",
        "Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and calcium channel blockers are often used to treat hypertension in dogs, although other drugs may be indicated for specific conditions causing high blood pressure."

        "Schönlein first published the name \"tuberculosis\" (German: Tuberkulose) in 1832.",
        "Between 1838 and 1845, John Croghan, the owner of Mammoth Cave in Kentucky from 1839 onwards, brought a number of people with tuberculosis into the cave in the hope of curing the disease with the constant temperature and purity of the cave air; each died within a year.",
        "Hermann Brehmer opened the first TB sanatorium in 1859 in Görbersdorf (now Sokołowsko) in Silesia.",
        "In 1905, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this discovery.",

        "What later became known as the Alexandra Hospital for Children with Hip Disease (tuberculous arthritis) was opened in London in 1867.",
        "During the first half of the 1900s, the risk of transmission from this source was dramatically reduced after the application of the pasteurization process.",
        "Koch announced a glycerine extract of the tubercle bacilli as a \"remedy\" for tuberculosis in 1890, calling it \"tuberculin\".",
        "World Tuberculosis Day is marked on 24 March each year, the anniversary of Koch's original scientific announcement.",
        "When the Medical Research Council formed in Britain in 1913, it initially focused on tuberculosis research.",
        "Albert Calmette and Camille Guérin achieved the first genuine success in immunization against tuberculosis in 1906, using attenuated bovine-strain tuberculosis.",
        "The BCG vaccine was first used on humans in 1921 in France, but achieved widespread acceptance in the US, Great Britain, and Germany only after World War II.",
        "In 1946, the development of the antibiotic streptomycin made effective treatment and cure of TB a reality.",
        "Prior to the introduction of this medication, the only treatment was surgical intervention, including the \"pneumothorax technique\", which involved collapsing an infected lung to \"rest\" it and to allow tuberculous lesions to heal.",
        "Between 1970 and 1990, there were numerous outbreaks of drug-resistant tuberculosis involving strains resistant to two or more drugs; these strains are called multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB).",
        "Treatment of MDR-TB requires treatment with second-line drugs, which in general are less effective, more toxic and more expensive than first-line drugs.",

        "Tuberculosis may cause extensive scarring of the lungs, which persists after successful treatment of the disease.",
        "bovis causes bovine TB and was once a common cause of human TB, but the introduction of pasteurized milk has almost eliminated this as a public health problem in developed countries.",
        "=== Risk factors === Risk factors for TB include exposure to droplets from people with active TB and environmental-related and health-condition related factors that decrease a person's immune system response such as HIV or taking immunosuppressant medications.",
        "Sub-Saharan Africa has a particularly high burden of HIV-associated TB.",
        "Another important risk factor is use of medications which suppress the immune system; these include, chemotherapy, medication for lupus or rheumatoid arthritis, and medication after an organ transplant.",

        "This does not destroy the tuberculosis bacilli, but contains them, preventing spread of the infection to other parts of the body.",
        "Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place.",
        "Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.",
        "=== Interferon-Gamma Release Assay === The Interferon-Gamma Release Assay (IGRA) is recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test.",
        "It is highly sensitive and specific with good turnaround time.",
        "== Prevention == The main strategies to prevent infection with TB are treatment of both active and latent TB, as well as vaccination of children who are at risk.",
        "Although latent TB is not infective, it should be treated in order to prevent its development into active pulmonary TB, which is infective.",
        "The cascade of person-to-person spread can be circumvented by segregating those with active (\"overt\") TB and putting them on anti-TB drug regimens.",
        "After about two weeks of effective treatment, subjects with nonresistant active infections generally do not remain contagious to others; however it is important to complete the full course of treatment which is usually six months.",
        "In countries where tuberculosis is common, one dose is recommended in healthy babies as soon after birth as possible.",
        "Administered to children under 5, it decreases the risk of getting the infection by 20% and the risk of infection turning into active disease by nearly 60%.",
        "Milk should be boiled, and meat should be carefully inspected, or else the cattle tested for infection.",
        "Cures for the disease included abundant food, particularly of a fatty nature, and life in the open air.",
        "==== Worldwide campaigns ==== The World Health Organization (WHO) declared TB a \"global health emergency\" in 1993, and in 2006, the Stop TB Partnership developed a Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis that aimed to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015.",
        "In 2014, the WHO adopted the \"End TB\" strategy which aims to reduce TB incidence by 80% and TB deaths by 90% by 2030.",
        "The goal of tuberculosis elimination is being hampered by the lack of rapid testing, short and effective treatment courses, and completely effective vaccines.",
        "== Management == Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria.",
        "=== Latent TB === People with latent infections are treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life.",
        "Treatment comprises a course of one or more of isoniazid, rifampin (also known as rifampicin) and rifapentine; the treatment regimen may last for between 3 and 9 months.",
        "Completing treatment is crucial to eliminate the bacteria completely, prevent recurrence, and avoid the development of drug resistance.",
        "=== New onset === Active TB is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance.",
        "The recommended treatment of new-onset pulmonary tuberculosis is a combination of antibiotics comprising rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for the first two months, followed by four months of only rifampicin and isoniazid; a total of six months.",
        "If the symptoms do not improve, further testing is necessary to establish if the infection is drug-resistant, and the treatment regime should be adjusted if necessary.",
        "=== Recurrent disease === If tuberculosis recurs, testing to determine which antibiotics it is sensitive to is important before determining treatment.",
        "If multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24 months is recommended.",
        "A treatment regimen for MDR-TB must take into account the patient's drug-resistance profile as well as individual factors such as age and localization of the disease.",
        "The duration of treatment can vary from 6 months to 18 months or longer.",
        "=== Adherence and support === It can be difficult for patients to adhere to their TB treatment regimen.",
        "Several drugs must be taken daily for a long period, often with unpleasant side effects.",
        "There is often a rapid improvement in symptoms, so that patients stop taking medication even though the infection is still active and likely to reassert symptoms after a period.",
        "In areas without public health systems, prolonged treatment is expensive.",
        "Failure to complete a course of treatment can result in the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.",
        "Public health bodies recommend that patients be given support during the period of treatment.",
        "One form of support is directly observed therapy - a healthcare worker watches the TB patient swallow the drugs, either in person or online.",
        "=== Medication resistance === Inadequate or incomplete treatment can select for resistant strains of the TB bacterium.",
        "Rifampicin resistant TB (RR-TB) is resistant to the drug rifampicin.",
        "Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid.",
        "Treatment for both MDR-TB and XDR-TB involves combinations of several drugs, typically including second-line anti-TB medications like bedaquiline, linezolid, and fluoroquinolones.",
        "Treatment regimens are individualized based on drug susceptibility testing and patient-specific factors, and may extend for up to 20 months.",
        "The proportion of previously treated TB cases with RR- or MDR-TB has also decreased from 25% in 2015 to an estimated 16% in 2023.",
        "WHO guidelines recommend a rapid molecular test, Xpert MTB/RIF, to diagnose TB and simultaneously detect rifampicin resistance.",
        "Drug susceptibility testing (DST) is crucial for fully identifying drug resistance and guiding treatment.",
        "Treatment of MDR-TB is significantly more costly than treating regular TB.",
        "As an example, in the UK in 2013 the cost of standard TB treatment was estimated at £5,000 while the cost of treating MDR-TB was estimated to be more than 10 times greater, ranging from £50,000 to £70,000 per case.",
        "Families may become impoverished due to the financial strain of MDR-TB treatment, with studies reporting that a significant portion of household income can be spent on healthcare.",
        "The risk of reactivation increases in those whose immune system becomes weakened, such as may be caused by certain drug treatments, or by infection with HIV.",
        "TB is almost always fatal in those with untreated HIV co-infection and death rates are increased even with antiretroviral treatment of HIV.",
        "In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active.",
        "Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of many factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis, and the emergence of drug-resistant cases in the 1980s.",
        "Improvements in public health were reducing tuberculosis even before the arrival of antibiotics, although the disease remained a significant threat to public health, such that when the Medical Research Council was formed in Britain in 1913 its initial focus was tuberculosis research.",
        "Around 8.2 million people were newly diagnosed with TB last year, allowing them access to treatment—a record high since WHO's tracking began in 1995 and an increase from 7.5 million cases in 2022.",

        "=== Law === Some countries have legislation to involuntarily detain or examine those suspected to have tuberculosis, or involuntarily treat them if infected.",
        "It provides results in about two hours, which is much faster than traditional TB culture methods.",
        "It has been neglected even in countries with a high burden and often forgotten by donors and those investing in health interventions.\" Slow progress has led to frustration, expressed by the executive director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria – Mark Dybul: \"we have the tools to end TB as a pandemic and public health threat on the planet, but we are not doing it.\" Several international organizations are pushing for more transparency in treatment, and more countries are implementing mandatory reporting of cases to the government as of 2014, although adherence is often variable.",

        "Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are effective, have been commonly used to prevent malaria, and their use has contributed significantly to the decrease in malaria in the 21st century.",
        "==== Insecticide-treated nets ==== Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people and reduce infection rates and transmission of malaria.",
        "Nets are not a perfect barrier and are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to find a way past the net.",
        "Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets and offer greater than 70% protection compared with no net.",

        "==== Indoor residual spraying ==== Indoor residual spraying is the spraying of insecticides on the walls inside a home.",
        "After feeding, many mosquitoes rest on a nearby surface while digesting the bloodmeal, so if the walls of houses have been coated with insecticides, the resting mosquitoes can be killed before they can bite another person and transfer the malaria parasite.",
        "As of 2006, the World Health Organization recommends 12 insecticides in IRS operations, including DDT and the pyrethroids cyfluthrin and deltamethrin.",
        "This public health use of small amounts of DDT is permitted under the Stockholm Convention, which prohibits its agricultural use.",

        "Antimalarial mass drug administration to an entire population at the same time may reduce the risk of contracting malaria in the population, however the effectiveness of mass drug administration may vary depending on the prevalence of malaria in the area.",
        "Other factors such as drug administration plus other protective measures such as mosquito control, the proportion of people treated in the area, and the risk of reinfection with malaria may play a role in the effectiveness of mass drug treatment approaches.",
        "The protective effect does not begin immediately, and people visiting areas where malaria exists usually start taking the drugs one to two weeks before they arrive, and continue taking them for four weeks after leaving (except for atovaquone/proguanil, which only needs to be started two days before and continued for seven days afterward).",
        "The use of preventive drugs is often not practical for those who live in areas where malaria exists, and their use is usually given only to pregnant women and short-term visitors.",
        "This is due to the cost of the drugs, side effects from long-term use, and the difficulty in obtaining antimalarial drugs outside of wealthy nations.",
        "During pregnancy, medication to prevent malaria has been found to improve the weight of the baby at birth and decrease the risk of anaemia in the mother.",

        "Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.",
        "The first promising studies demonstrating the potential for a malaria vaccine were performed in 1967 by immunising mice with live, radiation-attenuated sporozoites, which provided significant protection to the mice upon subsequent injection with normal, viable sporozoites.",
        "As of 2023, two malaria vaccines have been licensed for use.",

        "Providing free antimalarial drugs to households may reduce childhood deaths when used appropriately.",
        "Programmes which presumptively treat all causes of fever with antimalarial drugs may lead to overuse of antimalarials and undertreat other causes of fever.",
        "Nevertheless, the use of malaria rapid-diagnostic kits can help to reduce over-usage of antimalarials.",
        "=== Uncomplicated malaria === Simple or uncomplicated malaria may be treated with oral medications.",
        "Artemisinin drugs are effective and safe in treating uncomplicated malaria.",
        "Artemisinin in combination with other antimalarials (known as artemisinin-combination therapy, or ACT) is about 90% effective when used to treat uncomplicated malaria.",

        "The addition of primaquine with artemisinin-based combination therapy for falciparum malaria reduces its transmission at day 3–4 and day 8 of infection.",
        "Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus artesunate is better than sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine in controlling treatment failure at day 28.",
        "However, the latter is better than the former in reducing gametocytes in blood at day 7.",
        "vivax malaria requires both elimination of the parasite in the blood with chloroquine or with artemisinin-based combination therapy and clearance of parasites from the liver with an 8-aminoquinoline agent such as primaquine or tafenoquine.",

        "There is limited safety data on the antimalarial drugs in pregnancy.",
        "Recommended treatment for severe malaria is the intravenous use of antimalarial drugs.",
        "For severe malaria, parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in both children and adults.",
        "In another systematic review, artemisinin derivatives (artemether and arteether) were as efficacious as quinine in the treatment of cerebral malaria in children.",

        "=== Managing cerebral malaria === Cerebral malaria usually makes a patient comatose.",
        "In areas where there is a high prevalence of malaria infection (e.g. tropical region) treatment can start without testing first.",
        "To manage the cerebral malaria when confirmed the following can be done: People who are in coma should be given meticulous nursing care ( monitor vital signs, turn patient every 2 hours, avoid lying the patient in a wet bed etc.) A sterile urethral catheter should be inserted to help with urinating To aspirate stomach content, a sterile nasogastric tube should be inserted.",

        "=== Resistance === Drug resistance poses a growing problem in 21st-century malaria treatment.",
        "Resistance is now common against all classes of antimalarial drugs apart from artemisinins.",
        "Treatment of resistant strains became increasingly dependent on this class of drugs.",
        "Malaria strains found on the Cambodia–Thailand border are resistant to combination therapies that include artemisinins, and may, therefore, be untreatable.",
        "Exposure of the parasite population to artemisinin monotherapies in subtherapeutic doses for over 30 years and the availability of substandard artemisinins likely drove the selection of the resistant phenotype.",
        "Resistance to artemisinin has been detected in Cambodia, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and there has been emerging resistance in Laos.",
        "Resistance to the combination of artemisinin and piperaquine was first detected in 2013 in Cambodia, and by 2019 had spread across Cambodia and into Laos, Thailand and Vietnam (with up to 80 percent of malaria parasites resistant in some regions).",

        "In time, pest control, rather than disease control, came to dominate DDT use, and this large-scale agricultural use led to the evolution of pesticide-resistant mosquitoes in many regions.",
        "Before DDT, malaria was successfully eliminated or controlled in tropical areas like Brazil and Egypt by removing or poisoning the breeding grounds of the mosquitoes or the aquatic habitats of the larval stages, for example by applying the highly toxic arsenic compound Paris Green to places with standing water.",
        "Malaria was once common in the United States, but the US eliminated malaria from most parts of the country in the early 20th century using vector control programs, which combined the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, draining of wetland breeding grounds for agriculture and other changes in water management practices, and advances in sanitation, including greater use of glass windows and screens in dwellings.",
        "The use of the pesticide DDT and other means eliminated malaria from the remaining pockets in southern states of the US in the 1950s, as part of the National Malaria Eradication Program.",
        "The program relied largely on DDT for mosquito control and rapid diagnosis and treatment to break the transmission cycle.",
        "The program eliminated the disease in \"North America, Europe, the former Soviet Union\", and in \"Taiwan, much of the Caribbean, the Balkans, parts of northern Africa, the northern region of Australia, and a large swath of the South Pacific\" and dramatically reduced mortality in Sri Lanka and India.",
        "The evolution of resistance to first-generation drugs (e.g. chloroquine) and to insecticides exacerbated the situation.",
        "The program succeeded in eliminating malaria only in areas with \"high socio-economic status, well-organized healthcare systems, and relatively less intensive or seasonal malaria transmission\".",
        "For example, in Sri Lanka, the program reduced cases from about one million per year before spraying to just 18 in 1963 and 29 in 1964.",
        "The program switched to malathion, but despite initial successes, malaria continued its resurgence into the 1980s.",

        "As there is a dearth of clinical trial data and the drugs used to treat are prone to developing resistance, experts recommend reserving treatment for severe acute cases, not mild to moderate.",
        "==== Chronic ==== Chronic hepatitis B management aims to control viral replication, which is correlated with progression of disease.",
        "Seven drugs are approved in the United States: Adefovir dipivoxil, a nucleotide analogue, has been used to supplement lamivudine in patients who develop resistance, but is no longer recommended as first-line therapy.",
        "Entecavir is safe, well tolerated, less prone to developing resistance, and the most potent of the existing hepatitis B antivirals; it is thus a first-line treatment choice.",

        "Generally, the course of treatment is a minimum of one year with a minimum of six additional months of \"consolidation therapy.\" Based on viral response, longer therapy may be required, and certain patients require indefinite long-term therapy.",
        "Due to a less robust response in Asian patients, consolidation therapy is recommended to be extended to at least a year.",
        "All patients should be monitored for viral reactivation, which if identified, requires restarting treatment.",
        "Many patients develop resistance, which is correlated with longer treatment duration.",
        "Lamivudine as a single treatment is contraindicated in patients coinfected with HIV, as resistance develops rapidly, but it can be used as part of a multidrug regimen.",
        "Pegylated interferon (PEG IFN) is dosed just once a week as a subcutaneous injection and is both more convenient and effective than standard interferon.",
        "Although it does not develop resistance as do many of the oral antivirals, it is poorly tolerated and requires close monitoring.",
        "PEG IFN is estimated to cost about $18,000 per year in the United States, compared to $2,500–8,700 for the oral medications.",
        "Its treatment duration is 48 weeks, unlike oral antivirals which require indefinite treatment for most patients (minimum one year).",
        "PEG IFN is not effective in patients with high levels of viral activity and cannot be used in immunosuppressed patients or those with cirrhosis.",
        "Telbivudine is effective but not recommended as first-line treatment; as compared to entecavir, it is both less potent and more resistance prone.",
        "Tenofovir is a nucleotide analogue and an antiretroviral drug that is also used to treat HIV infection.",

        "Treatment initiation is guided by recommendations issued by The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and is based on detectable viral levels, HBeAg positive or negative status, ALT levels, and in certain cases, family history of HCC and liver biopsy.",
        "In patients with compensated cirrhosis, treatment is recommended regardless of HBeAg status or ALT level, but recommendations differ regarding HBV DNA levels; AASLD recommends treating at DNA levels detectable above 2x103 IU/mL; EASL and WHO recommend treating when HBV DNA levels are detectable at any level.",

        "Duration of and response to these treatments varies based on genotype.",
        "In high-resource countries, they have been supplanted by direct acting antiviral agents, which first appeared in 2011; these agents target proteins responsible for viral replication and include the following three classes: NS3 and NS4A protease inhibitors, including telaprevir, boceprevir, simeprevir, and others NS5A inhibitors, including ledipasvir, daclatasvir, and others NS5B inhibitors, including sofosbuvir, dasabuvir, and others These drugs are used in various combinations, sometimes combined with ribavirin, based on the patient's genotype, delineated as genotypes 1–6.",
        "Genotype 1 (GT1), which is the most prevalent genotype in the United States and around the world, can now be cured with a direct acting antiviral regimen.",
        "First-line therapy for GT1 is a combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (SOF/LDV) for 12 weeks for most patients, including those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis.",
        "Certain patients with early disease need only 8 weeks of treatment while those with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis who have not responded to prior treatment require 24 weeks.",

        "Those with major depressive disorder are typically treated with psychotherapy and antidepressant medication.",
        "While a mainstay of treatment, the clinical efficacy of antidepressants is controversial.",
        "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered if other measures are not effective.",
        "Risk factors include a family history of the condition, major life changes, childhood traumas, environmental lead exposure, certain medications, chronic health problems, and substance use disorders.",
        "Some antidepressants may also cause insomnia due to their stimulating effect.",
        "Diagnosis and treatment is further complicated in that the elderly are often simultaneously treated with a number of other drugs, and often have other concurrent diseases.",
        "Depression may also be iatrogenic (the result of healthcare), such as drug-induced depression.",
        "Therapies associated with depression include interferons, beta blockers, isotretinoin, contraceptives, cardiac agents, anticonvulsants, and hormonal agents.",
        "Derived from the effectiveness of monoaminergic drugs in treating depression, the monoamine theory posits that insufficient activity of monoamine neurotransmitters is the primary cause of depression.",
        "However, the monoamine theory is inconsistent with observations that serotonin depletion does not cause depression in healthy persons, that antidepressants instantly increase levels of monoamines but take weeks to work, and the existence of atypical antidepressants which can be effective despite not targeting this pathway.",
        "One proposed explanation for the therapeutic lag, and further support for the deficiency of monoamines, is a desensitization of self-inhibition in raphe nuclei by the increased serotonin mediated by antidepressants.",
        "HPA-axis abnormalities have been suggested in depression given the association of CRHR1 with depression and the increased frequency of dexamethasone test non-suppression in people who are depressed.",
        "Furthermore, a meta-analysis yielded decreased dexamethasone suppression, and increased response to psychological stressors.",
        "Research suggests that treatments can reduce pro-inflammatory cell production, like the experimental treatment of ketamine with treatment-resistant depression.",
        "This, in turn, causes the production of PGE2, which is a prostaglandin, and this catalyzes the production of indolamine, IDO.",
        "IDO causes tryptophan to get converted into kynurenine, and kynurenine becomes quinolinic acid.",
        "Quinolinic acid is an agonist for NMDA receptors, so it activates the pathway.",
        "With this, researchers have also seen that the concentration of quinolinic acid correlates to the severity of depressive symptoms.",
        "Adverse affective reactions to medications or alcohol misuse may be ruled out, as well.",
        "In general, investigations are not repeated for a subsequent episode unless there is a medical indication.",
        "Catatonic symptoms also occur in schizophrenia or in manic episodes, or may be caused by neuroleptic malignant syndrome.",
        "They include depressions due to physical illness, medications, and substance use disorders.",
        "When the depression is caused by a medication, non-medical use of a psychoactive substance, or exposure to a toxin, it is then diagnosed as a specific mood disorder (previously called substance-induced mood disorder).",
        "Behavioral interventions, such as interpersonal therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, are effective at preventing new onset depression.",
        "Because such interventions appear to be most effective when delivered to individuals or small groups, it has been suggested that they may be able to reach their large target audience most efficiently through the Internet.",
        "The course is claimed to be the most successful of psychoeducational interventions for the treatment and prevention of depression (both for its adaptability to various populations and its results), with a risk reduction of 38% in major depression and an efficacy as a treatment comparing favorably to other psychotherapies.",
        "== Management == The most common and effective treatments for depression are psychotherapy, medication, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT); a combination of treatments is the most effective approach when depression is resistant to treatment.",
        "American Psychiatric Association treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and personal preference.",
        "Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all people with severe depression unless ECT is planned.",
        "There is evidence that collaborative care by a team of health care practitioners produces better results than routine single-practitioner care.",
        "Psychotherapy is the treatment of choice (over medication) for people under 18, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), third wave CBT and interpersonal therapy may help prevent depression.",
        "The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.",
        "The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least six months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants.: 305–450 Treatment options are more limited in developing countries, where access to mental health staff, medication, and psychotherapy is often difficult.",
        "=== Lifestyle === Physical exercise has been found to be effective for major depression, and may be recommended to people who are willing, motivated, and healthy enough to participate in an exercise program as treatment.",
        "It is equivalent to the use of medications or psychological therapies in most people.",
        "=== Talking therapies === Talking therapy (psychotherapy) can be delivered to individuals, groups, or families by mental health professionals, including psychotherapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, clinical social workers, counselors, and psychiatric nurses.",
        "A 2012 review found psychotherapy to be better than no treatment but not other treatments.",
        "With more complex and chronic forms of depression, a combination of medication and psychotherapy may be used.",
        "There is moderate-quality evidence that psychological therapies are a useful addition to standard antidepressant treatment of treatment-resistant depression in the short term.",
        "Psychotherapy has been shown to be effective in older people.",
        "Successful psychotherapy appears to reduce the recurrence of depression even after it has been stopped or replaced by occasional booster sessions.",
        "The most-studied form of psychotherapy for depression is CBT, which teaches clients to challenge self-defeating, but enduring ways of thinking (cognitions) and change counter-productive behaviors.",
        "CBT can perform as well as antidepressants in people with major depression.",
        "CBT has the most research evidence for the treatment of depression in children and adolescents, and CBT and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) are preferred therapies for adolescent depression.",
        "In people under 18, according to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, medication should be offered only in conjunction with a psychological therapy, such as CBT, interpersonal therapy, or family therapy.",
        "Several variables predict success for cognitive behavioral therapy in adolescents: higher levels of rational thoughts, less hopelessness, fewer negative thoughts, and fewer cognitive distortions.",
        "Cognitive behavioral therapy and occupational programs (including modification of work activities and assistance) have been shown to be effective in reducing sick days taken by workers with depression.",
        "Several variants of cognitive behavior therapy have been used in those with depression, the most notable being rational emotive behavior therapy, and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy.",

        "In a meta-analysis of three controlled trials of Short Psychodynamic Supportive Psychotherapy, this modification was found to be as effective as medication for mild to moderate depression.",
        "=== Antidepressants === Conflicting results have arisen from studies that look at the effectiveness of antidepressants in people with acute, mild to moderate depression.",
        "A review commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (UK) concluded that there is strong evidence that SSRIs, such as escitalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline, have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression.",
        "Similarly, a Cochrane systematic review of clinical trials of the generic tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline concluded that there is strong evidence that its efficacy is superior to placebo.",
        "Antidepressants work less well for the elderly than for younger individuals with depression.",
        "To find the most effective antidepressant medication with minimal side-effects, the dosages can be adjusted, and if necessary, combinations of different classes of antidepressants can be tried.",
        "Response rates to the first antidepressant administered range from 50 to 75%, and it can take at least six to eight weeks from the start of medication to improvement.",
        "Antidepressant medication treatment is usually continued for 6–9 months after remission, to minimize the chance of recurrence, and even up to two years of continuation is recommended.: 305–450 SSRIs are the primary medications prescribed, owing to their relatively mild side-effects, and safety.",
        "People who do not respond to one SSRI can be switched to another antidepressant, and this results in improvement in almost 50% of cases.",
        "Another option is to augment the atypical antidepressant bupropion to the SSRI as an adjunctive treatment.",
        "Venlafaxine, an antidepressant with a different mechanism of action, may be modestly more effective than SSRIs. However, venlafaxine is not recommended in the UK as a first-line treatment because of evidence suggesting its risks may outweigh benefits, and it is specifically discouraged in children and adolescents as it increases the risk of suicidal thoughts or attempts.",
        "For children and adolescents with moderate-to-severe depressive disorder, fluoxetine seems to be the best treatment (either with or without cognitive behavioural therapy) but more research is needed to be certain.",
        "Any antidepressant can cause low blood sodium levels; nevertheless, it has been reported more often with SSRIs. It is not uncommon for SSRIs to cause or worsen insomnia; the sedating atypical antidepressant mirtazapine can be used in such cases.",
        "Irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, an older class of antidepressants, have been plagued by potentially life-threatening dietary and drug interactions.",
        "The safety profile is different with reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as moclobemide, where the risk of serious dietary interactions is negligible and dietary restrictions are less strict.",
        "It is unclear whether antidepressants affect a person's risk of suicide.",
        "For children, adolescents, and probably young adults between 18 and 24 years old, there is a higher risk of both suicidal ideations and suicidal behavior in those treated with SSRIs. For adults, it is unclear whether SSRIs affect the risk of suicidality.",
        "A black box warning was introduced in the United States in 2007 on SSRIs and other antidepressant medications due to the increased risk of suicide in people younger than 24 years old.",
        "=== Other medications and supplements === The combined use of antidepressants plus benzodiazepines demonstrates improved effectiveness when compared to antidepressants alone, but these effects may not endure.",
        "The addition of a benzodiazepine is balanced against possible harms and other alternative treatment strategies when antidepressant mono-therapy is considered inadequate.",
        "For treatment-resistant depression, adding on the atypical antipsychotic brexpiprazole for short-term or acute management may be considered.",
        "Brexpiprazole may be effective for some people, however, the evidence as of 2023 supporting its use is weak and this medication has potential adverse effects including weight gain and akathisia.",
        "Brexpiprazole has not been sufficiently studied in older people or children and the use and effectiveness of this adjunctive therapy for longer term management is not clear.",
        "Ketamine may have a rapid antidepressant effect lasting less than two weeks; there is limited evidence of any effect after that, common acute side effects, and longer-term studies of safety and adverse effects are needed.",
        "A nasal spray form of esketamine was approved by the FDA in March 2019 for use in treatment-resistant depression when combined with an oral antidepressant; risk of substance use disorder and concerns about its safety, serious adverse effects, tolerability, effect on suicidality, lack of information about dosage, whether the studies on it adequately represent broad populations, and escalating use of the product have been raised by an international panel of experts.",
        "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and cytokine inhibitors may be effective in treating depression.",
        "For instance, celecoxib, an NSAID, is a selective COX-2 inhibitor– which is an enzyme that helps in the production of pain and inflammation.",
        "In recent clinical trials, this NSAID has been shown helpful with treatment-resistant depression as it helps inhibit proinflammatory signaling.",
        "Statins, which are anti-inflammatory medications prescribed to lower cholesterol levels, have also been shown to have antidepressant effects.",
        "When prescribed for patients already taking SSRIs, this add-on treatment was shown to improve anti-depressant effects of SSRIs when compared to the placebo group.",
        "With this, statins have been shown to be effective in preventing depression in some cases too.",
        "Lithium appears effective at lowering the risk of suicide in those with bipolar disorder and unipolar depression by about 80%.",
        "There is a narrow range of effective and safe dosages of lithium thus close monitoring may be needed.",
        "Low-dose thyroid hormone may be added to existing antidepressants to treat persistent depression symptoms.",
        "Limited evidence suggests stimulants, such as amphetamine and modafinil, may be effective in the short term, or as adjuvant therapy.",
        "Also, it is suggested that folate supplements may have a role in depression management.",
        "=== Electroconvulsive therapy === Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a standard psychiatric treatment in which seizures are electrically induced in a person with depression to provide relief from psychiatric illnesses.",
        "ECT is used with informed consent as a last line of intervention for major depressive disorder.",
        "A round of ECT is effective for about 50% of people with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, whether it is unipolar or bipolar.",
        "Follow-up treatment is still poorly studied, but about half of people who respond relapse within twelve months.",
        "Aside from effects in the brain, the general physical risks of ECT are similar to those of brief general anesthesia.: 259 Immediately following treatment, the most common adverse effects are confusion and memory loss.",
        "ECT is considered one of the least harmful treatment options available for severely depressed pregnant women.",
        "A usual course of ECT involves multiple administrations, typically given two or three times per week, with a total of six to twelve treatments.",
        "Electroconvulsive therapy can differ in its application in three ways: electrode placement, frequency of treatments, and the electrical waveform of the stimulus.",
        "These three forms of application have significant differences in both adverse side effects and symptom remission.",
        "After treatment, drug therapy is usually continued, and some people receive maintenance ECT.",
        "ECT appears to work in the short term via an anticonvulsant effect mostly in the frontal lobes, and longer term via neurotrophic effects primarily in the medial temporal lobe.",
        "TMS was approved by the FDA for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (trMDD) in 2008.",
        "Recent systematic reviews have found that the effects of TMS on clinical response, remission, and severity in depression appear not to be statistically or clinically significant.",
        "The American Psychiatric Association, the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Disorders, and the Royal Australia and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists have endorsed TMS for trMDD.",
        "Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is another noninvasive method used to stimulate small regions of the brain with a weak electric current.",
        "Several meta-analyses have concluded that active tDCS was useful for treating depression.",
        "Besides sleepiness, this method can cause a side effect of mania or hypomania.",
        "The microbiome of people with major depressive disorder differs from that of healthy people, and probiotic and synbiotic treatment may achieve a modest depressive symptom reduction.",
        "With this, fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) are being researched as add-on therapy treatments for people who do not respond to typical therapies.",
        "It has been shown that the patient's depressive symptoms improved, with minor gastrointestinal issues, after a FMT, with improvements in symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks after the transplant.",
        "Studies recruiting from selective inpatient sources suggest lower recovery and higher chronicity, while studies of mostly outpatients show that nearly all recover, with a median episode duration of 11 months.",
        "A high proportion of people who experience full symptomatic remission still have at least one not fully resolved symptom after treatment.",
        "Recurrence or chronicity is more likely if symptoms have not fully resolved with treatment.",
        "Current guidelines recommend continuing antidepressants for four to six months after remission to prevent relapse.",
        "Evidence from many randomized controlled trials indicates continuing antidepressant medications after recovery can reduce the chance of relapse by 70% (41% on placebo vs.",
        "Outpatients on a waiting list show a 10–15% reduction in symptoms within a few months, with approximately 20% no longer meeting the full criteria for a depressive disorder.",
        "The combination of usual clinical care and support with return to work (like working less hours or changing tasks) probably reduces sick leave by 15%, and leads to fewer depressive symptoms and improved work capacity, reducing sick leave by an annual average of 25 days per year.",
        "Additional psychological interventions (such as online cognitive behavioral therapy) lead to fewer sick days compared to standard management only.",
        "Streamlining care or adding specific providers for depression care may help to reduce sick leave.",
        "Out of all the people suffering from MDD, only about 35% seek help from a professional for their disorder.",
        "Both symptoms and treatment among the elderly differ from those of the rest of the population.",
        "From the 14th century, \"to depress\" meant to subjugate or to bring down in spirits.",
        "There has been some criticism of the expansion of coverage of the diagnosis, related to the development and promotion of antidepressants and the biological model since the late 1950s.",

        "Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in his Faust, Part One, published in 1808, has Mephistopheles assume the form of a black dog, specifically a poodle.",
        "While some remain skeptical about antidepressants, recent studies show a more balanced view.",
        "Many patients recognize their benefits but have concerns about side effects and personality changes.",
        "In the UK, the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Royal College of General Practitioners conducted a joint Five-year Defeat Depression campaign to educate and reduce stigma from 1992 to 1996; a MORI study conducted afterwards showed a small positive change in public attitudes to depression and treatment.",

        "A 2015 Cochrane review of Morita therapy for anxiety disorder in adults found not enough evidence to draw a conclusion.",
        "=== Medications === First-line choices for medications include SSRIs or SNRIs to treat generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder or panic disorder.",
        "For adults, there is no good evidence supporting which specific medication in the SSRI or SNRI class is best for treating anxiety, so cost often drives drug choice.",
        "Fluvoxamine is effective in treating a range of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents.",
        "Fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine can also help with some forms of anxiety in children and adolescents.",
        "If the chosen medicine is effective, it is recommended that it be continued for at least a year to mitigate the risk of a relapse.",
        "Benzodiazepines are a second line option for the pharmacologic treatment of anxiety.",
        "Benzodiazepines are associated with moderate to high effect sizes with regard to symptom relief and they have an onset usually within 1 week.",
        "Clonazepam has a longer half life and may possibly be used as once per day dosing.",
        "Benzodiazepines may also be used with SNRIs or SSRIs to initially reduce anxiety symptoms, and they may potentially be continued long term.",
        "Benzodiazepines are not a first line pharmacologic treatment of anxiety disorders and they carry risks of physical dependence, psychological dependence, overdose death (especially when combined with opioids), misuse, cognitive impairment, falls and motor vehicle crashes.",
        "Buspirone and pregabalin are second-line treatments for people who do not respond to SSRIs or SNRIs. Pregabalin and gabapentin are effective in treating some anxiety disorders, but there is concern regarding their off-label use due to the lack of strong scientific evidence for their efficacy in multiple conditions and their proven side effects.",
        "Medications need to be used with care among older adults, who are more likely to have side effects because of coexisting physical disorders.",

        "A meta-analysis found 2000 mg/day or more of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as fish oil, tended to reduce anxiety in placebo-controlled and uncontrolled studies, particularly in people with more significant symptoms.",
        "=== Treatments for children === Both therapy and a number of medications have been found to be useful for treating childhood anxiety disorders.",
        "Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a good first-line therapy approach.",
        "Studies have gathered substantial evidence for treatments that are not CBT-based as effective forms of treatment, expanding treatment options for those who do not respond to CBT.",
        "Although studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of CBT for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, evidence that it is more effective than treatment as usual, medication, or wait list controls is inconclusive.",
        "Like adults, children may undergo psychotherapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, or counseling.",
        "Family therapy is a form of treatment in which the child meets with a therapist together with the primary guardians and siblings.",
        "Each family member may attend individual therapy, but family therapy is typically a form of group therapy.",

        "Even after cardiac bypass surgery, no increase in mortality is seen in the overweight and obese.",
        "One study found that the improved survival could be explained by the more aggressive treatment obese people receive after a cardiac event.",
        "Some other factors have been proposed as causes towards rising rates of obesity worldwide, including insufficient sleep, endocrine disruptors, increased usage of certain medications (such as atypical antipsychotics), increases in ambient temperature, decreased rates of smoking, demographic changes, increasing maternal age of first-time mothers, changes to epigenetic dysregulation from the environment, increased phenotypic variance via assortative mating, social pressure to diet, among others.",
        "=== Other illnesses === Certain physical and mental illnesses and the pharmaceutical substances used to treat them can increase risk of obesity.",
        "=== Drug-induced obesity === Certain medications may cause weight gain or changes in body composition; these include insulin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, atypical antipsychotics, antidepressants, steroids, certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin and valproate), pizotifen, and some forms of hormonal contraception.",
        "Those who quit smoking gain an average of 4.4 kilograms (9.7 lb) for men and 5.0 kilograms (11.0 lb) for women over ten years.",

        "Out of 25 anti-obesity medications withdrawn from the market between 1964 and 2009, 23 acted by altering the functions of chemical neurotransmitters in the brain.",
        "The most common side effects of these drugs that led to withdrawals were mental disturbances, cardiac side effects, and drug abuse or drug dependence.",
        "Five medications beneficial for long-term use are: orlistat, lorcaserin, liraglutide, phentermine–topiramate, and naltrexone–bupropion.",
        "They result in weight loss after one year ranged from 3.0 to 6.7 kg (6.6-14.8 lbs) over placebo.",
        "Orlistat, liraglutide, and naltrexone–bupropion are available in both the United States and Europe, phentermine–topiramate is available only in the United States.",
        "European regulatory authorities rejected lorcaserin and phentermine-topiramate, in part because of associations of heart valve problems with lorcaserin and more general heart and blood vessel problems with phentermine–topiramate.",
        "Lorcaserin was available in the United States and then removed from the market in 2020 due to its association with cancer.",
        "Orlistat use is associated with high rates of gastrointestinal side effects and concerns have been raised about negative effects on the kidneys.",
        "There is no information on how these drugs affect longer-term complications of obesity such as cardiovascular disease or death; however, liraglutide, when used for type 2 diabetes, does reduce cardiovascular events.",
        "In 2019 a systematic review compared the effects on weight of various doses of fluoxetine (60 mg/d, 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d, 10 mg/d) in obese adults.",
        "When compared to placebo, all dosages of fluoxetine appeared to contribute to weight loss but lead to increased risk of experiencing side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea during period of treatment.",
        "When comparing, in the same review, the effects of fluoxetine on weight of obese adults, to other anti-obesity agents, omega-3 gel and not receiving a treatment, the authors could not reach conclusive results due to poor quality of evidence.",
        "Among antipsychotic drugs for treating schizophrenia clozapine is the most effective, but it also has the highest risk of causing the metabolic syndrome, of which obesity is the main feature.",
        "For people who gain weight because of clozapine, taking metformin may reportedly improve three of the five components of the metabolic syndrome: waist circumference, fasting glucose, and fasting triglycerides.",
        "=== Surgery === The most effective treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery.",
        "The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion.",
        "Surgery for severe obesity is associated with long-term weight loss, improvement in obesity-related conditions, and decreased overall mortality; however, improved metabolic health results from the weight loss, not the surgery.",
        "One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending on the type of procedure performed) at 10 years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures.",
        "In 1997, the WHO formally recognized obesity as a global epidemic.",

        "However, the longer people live, the more medical costs they incur.",
        "Sin taxes such as a sugary drink tax have been implemented in certain countries globally to curb dietary and consumer habits, and as an effort to offset the economic tolls.",
        "The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance that would otherwise be free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health.",
        "These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35 kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.",
        "The healthcare industry has had to invest in special facilities for handling patients with class III obesity, including special lifting equipment and bariatric ambulances.",
        "With the American Medical Association's 2013 classification of obesity as a chronic disease, it is thought that health insurance companies will more likely pay for obesity treatment, counseling and surgery, and the cost of research and development of adipose treatment pills or gene therapy treatments should be more affordable if insurers help to subsidize their cost.",

        "In many countries, people with epilepsy face driving restrictions and must be seizure-free for a set period before regaining eligibility to drive.",
        "Common triggers include sleep deprivation, stress, fever, illness, menstruation, alcohol, and certain medications.",
        "Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is particularly prevalent among children with epilepsy, occurring three to five times more often than in the general population.",
        "These typically respond well to treatment or remit with age.",
        "A detailed clinical history remains essential, supported by eyewitness accounts and, when possible, video recordings.",
        "A routine EEG may include activation techniques such as hyperventilation or photic stimulation.",
        "Accurate diagnosis is essential, as inappropriate treatment may delay effective care or cause harm.",
        "Delays in diagnosis can lead to prolonged morbidity and inappropriate treatment, highlighting the importance of careful clinical assessment and appropriate use of EEG and video documentation.",
        "Perinatal care, including prevention of birth trauma, hypoxia, and maternal infections, can lower the risk of epilepsy in infants.",
        "In older adults, reducing the risk of stroke, traumatic brain injury, and cardiovascular disease may also help prevent epilepsy.",
        "Medication side effects, including fatigue, mood changes, and cognitive slowing, may also contribute to complications in some individuals.",
        "Comprehensive management aims to reduce these risks by achieving seizure control, minimizing adverse effects, and addressing comorbid conditions.",
        "== Management == The primary goals of epilepsy management are to control seizures, minimize treatment side effects, and optimize quality of life.",
        "=== First aid and acute management of seizures === During a generalized tonic–clonic seizure, the primary goals are to ensure safety and prevent injury.",
        "Clear the space of sharp objects, furniture, or anything that might cause injury.",
        "If the person is standing, gently guide them to the ground to avoid a fall.",
        "Position the person on their side and into the recovery position, which helps keep the airway clear and reduces the risk of choking.",
        "If possible, place something soft (e.g., a jacket or cushion) under their head to prevent injury.",
        "Do not put anything in their mouth, as this may cause harm.",
        "Convulsive status epilepticus requires immediate medical attention to prevent serious complications.",
        "In a community setting (such as at home or in the ambulance), first-line treatment includes the administration of benzodiazepines.",
        "If the person has an individualized emergency management plan — which may have been developed with healthcare providers and outlines personalized treatment steps (such as the use of buccal midazolam or rectal diazepam) — this plan should be followed immediately.",
        "If seizures continue after the first dose of benzodiazepine, emergency medical services should be contacted, and further doses can be given.",
        "For ongoing seizures, levetiracetam, phenytoin, or sodium valproate may be used as second-line treatments, with levetiracetam preferred for its quicker action and fewer side effects.",
        "Most institutions have a preferred pathway or protocol to be used in a seizure emergency like status epilepticus.",
        "These protocols have been found to be effective in reducing time to delivery of treatment.",
        "=== Medications === The primary treatment for epilepsy involves the use of antiseizure medications (ASMs), which aim to control seizures while minimizing side effects.",
        "Treatment plans should be individualized, taking into account the seizure type, epilepsy syndrome, patient age, sex, comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and the potential for drug interactions.",
        "First-line treatment for most individuals with epilepsy is monotherapy with a single ASM.",
        "For many people with epilepsy, seizure control is achieved with a single medication, but some may require combination therapy if seizures are not well-controlled with monotherapy.",
        "There are a number of medications available including phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate.",
        "Evidence suggests that these drugs are similarly effective for both focal and generalized seizures, although their side-effect profiles vary.",
        "Controlled release carbamazepine appears to work as well as immediate release carbamazepine, and may have fewer side effects.",
        "In the UK, carbamazepine or lamotrigine are recommended as first-line treatments for focal seizures, with levetiracetam and valproate used as second-line treatments due to concerns about cost and side effects.",
        "Valproate is the first-line choice for generalized seizures, while lamotrigine is used as second-line.",
        "For absence seizures, ethosuximide or valproate are recommended, with valproate also being effective for myoclonic and tonic–clonic seizures.",
        "Controlled-release formulations of carbamazepine may be preferred in some cases, as they appear to be equally effective as immediate-release carbamazepine but may have fewer side effects.",
        "Once a person’s seizures are well-controlled on a specific treatment, it is generally not necessary to routinely check medication blood levels, unless there are concerns about side effects or toxicity.",
        "While phenytoin and carbamazepine are commonly used as first-line treatments due to their availability and low cost, newer drugs like levetiracetam and lamotrigine may not be accessible.",
        "The least expensive anticonvulsant is phenobarbital at around US$5 a year.",
        "The World Health Organization gives it a first-line recommendation in LMICs and it is commonly used in these countries.",
        "Access, however, may be difficult as some countries label it as a controlled drug.",
        "Adverse effects from medications are reported in 10% to 90% of people, depending on how and from whom the data is collected.",
        "Certain medications have side effects that are not related to dose such as rashes, liver toxicity, or suppression of the bone marrow.",
        "Up to a quarter of people stop treatment due to adverse effects.",
        "Some medications are associated with birth defects when used in pregnancy.",
        "Many of the common used medications, such as valproate, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and gabapentin have been reported to cause increased risk of birth defects, especially when used during the first trimester.",
        "Despite this, treatment is often continued once effective, because the risk of untreated epilepsy is believed to be greater than the risk of the medications.",
        "Among the antiepileptic medications, levetiracetam and lamotrigine seem to carry the lowest risk of causing birth defects.",
        "Slowly stopping medications may be reasonable in some people who do not have a seizure for two to four years; however, around a third of people have a recurrence, most often during the first six months.",
        "Measuring medication levels is not generally needed in those whose seizures are well controlled.",
        "=== Surgery === Epilepsy surgery is an important treatment option for individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy, typically defined as the failure of at least two appropriately chosen and tolerated antiseizure medications.",
        "Surgery is most effective in cases of focal epilepsy, where seizures originate from a specific area of the brain that can be safely removed.",
        "Although epilepsy surgery has demonstrated strong evidence of efficacy — especially in drug-resistant focal epilepsy — it remains underutilized worldwide and is often reserved for individuals whose condition has reached an advanced or chronic stage.",
        "Early consideration and referral for surgical evaluation can improve long-term outcomes and quality of life.",
        "Early referral improves the likelihood of successful outcomes and avoids prolonged periods of unnecessary disability.",
        "The primary goal of epilepsy surgery is to achieve seizure freedom, but even when that is not possible, palliative procedures that significantly reduce seizure frequency can lead to meaningful improvements in quality of life and development — particularly in children.",
        "Studies suggest that 60-70% of individuals with drug-resistant focal epilepsy experience a substantial reduction in seizures following surgery.",
        "Common procedures include anterior temporal lobe resection, which often involves removal of the hippocampus in cases of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, as well as lesionectomy for tumors or cortical dysplasia, and lobectomy for larger seizure foci.",
        "In cases where resection is not possible, procedures such as corpus callosotomy may help reduce the severity and spread of seizures.",
        "In addition to traditional resective techniques, minimally invasive approaches such as MRI-guided laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) have gained traction as safer alternatives in select cases, particularly where reducing cognitive impact and recovery time is a priority.",
        "In many cases, antiseizure medications can be tapered following successful surgery, though long-term monitoring remains essential.",
        "A 2023 systematic review found that early surgery in children under 3 years with drug-resistant epilepsy can result in meaningful seizure reduction or freedom when other treatments have failed.",
        "==== Neuromodulation ==== Neuromodulation therapies, including vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and responsive neurostimulation (RNS), are treatment options for individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy who are not candidates for resective surgery, or for whom previous surgery has not resulted in seizure freedom.",
        "These therapies aim to reduce seizure frequency and severity by delivering controlled electrical stimulation to targeted neural circuits.",
        "=== Diet === Dietary therapy, particularly the ketogenic diet (high-fat, low-carbohydrate, adequate-protein), is a non-pharmacological treatment option used primarily in children with drug-resistant epilepsy.",
        "Evidence suggests that children on a classical ketogenic diet may be up to three times more likely to achieve seizure freedom and up to six times more likely to experience a ≥50% reduction in seizure frequency compared to those receiving standard care.",
        "In adults, the ketogenic diet has shown limited evidence of achieving seizure freedom, though it may increase the likelihood of seizure reduction.",
        "It is typically supervised by a multidisciplinary team, including neurologists and dietitians, due to its restrictive nature and potential side effects, such as vomiting, constipation and diarrhoea.",
        "A gluten-free diet has been proposed in rare cases of epilepsy associated with celiac disease and occipital calcifications, though evidence is limited and based on small case series.",
        "=== Adjunctive and complementary therapies === There is moderate-quality evidence supporting the use of psychological interventions — such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), relaxation techniques, and self-management training — alongside standard treatment.",
        "For example, those who are sensitive to light may have success with using a small television, avoiding video games, or wearing dark glasses.",
        "Biofeedback, particularly EEG-based operant conditioning, has shown preliminary benefit in some people with drug-resistant epilepsy.",
        "Cannabidiol (CBD) has shown benefit as an add-on therapy in certain severe childhood epilepsies.",
        "A purified form of CBD was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2018 and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2020 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome, Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis complex.",
        "Some anti-seizure medications interact with enzymes in the liver and cause the drugs in hormonal contraception to be broken down more quickly.",
        "These enzyme inducing drugs make hormonal contraception less effective, and this is particularly hazardous if the anti-seizure medication is associated with birth defects.",
        "Potent enzyme-inducing anti-seizure medications include carbamazepine, eslicarbazepine acetate, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, primidone, and rufinamide.",
        "The drugs perampanel and topiramate can be enzyme-inducing at higher doses.",
        "Conversely, hormonal contraception can lower the amount of the anti-seizure medication lamotrigine circulating in the body, making it less effective.",
        "The failure rate of oral contraceptives, when used correctly, is 1%, but this increases to between 3–6% in women with epilepsy.",
        "Overall, intrauterine devices (IUDs) are preferred for women with epilepsy who are not intending to become pregnant.",
        "The first concern is about the risk of seizures during pregnancy, and the second concern is that the anti-seizure medications may result in birth defects.",
        "Most women with epilepsy must continue treatment with anti-seizure drugs, and the treatment goal is to balance the need to prevent seizures with the need to prevent drug-induced birth defects.",
        "In addition to this typical level of risk, some anti-seizure drugs significantly increase the risk of birth defects and intrauterine growth restriction, as well as developmental, neurocognitive, and behavioral disorders.",
        "Most women with epilepsy receive safe and effective treatment and have typical, healthy children.",
        "The highest risks are associated with specific anti-seizure drugs, such as valproic acid and carbamazepine, and with higher doses.",
        "Folic acid supplementation, such as through prenatal vitamins, reduced the risk.",
        "Planning pregnancies in advance gives women with epilepsy an opportunity to switch to a lower-risk treatment program and reduced drug doses.",
        "Although anti-seizure drugs can be found in breast milk, women with epilepsy can breastfeed their babies, and the benefits usually outweigh the risks.",
        "== Prognosis == Epilepsy is generally considered a chronic neurological condition, but its long-term course can vary widely depending on factors such as seizure type, underlying cause, and response to treatment.",
        "Although epilepsy is not typically \"cured,\" in many cases it may be considered resolved.",
        "According to the ILAE, epilepsy is considered to be resolved in individuals who have been seizure-free for at least 10 years, with no antiseizure medications for the last 5 of those years.",
        "Approximately 60–70% of individuals with epilepsy achieve good seizure control with appropriate antiseizure medications, and many can maintain long-term remission.",
        "Early treatment response is one of the strongest predictors of long-term outcome, with poor early control correlating with lower chances of remission.",
        "In these countries, to 75% of individuals with epilepsy do not receive the treatment they need.",
        "The person described in the text was diagnosed as being under the influence of a moon god, and underwent an exorcism.",
        "The oldest known detailed record of the condition itself is in the Sakikku, a Babylonian cuneiform medical text from 1067–1046 BC.",
        "As the Babylonians had no biomedical understanding of the nature of epilepsy, they attributed the seizures to possession by evil spirits and called for treating the condition through spiritual means.",
        "In his landmark work On the Sacred Disease, he proposed that epilepsy was not divine in origin and instead was a medically treatable problem originating in the brain.",
        "In Ancient Rome people did not eat or drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was affected.",
        "In the mid-19th century, the first effective anti-seizure medication, bromide, was introduced.",
        "The first modern treatment, phenobarbital, was developed in 1912, with phenytoin coming into use in 1938.",
        "Despite the availability of effective antiseizure medications and cost-effective treatment strategies, a large treatment gap persists in many countries, underscoring the need for strengthened health systems and public health interventions.",
        "Greater stigma was observed among relatives of patients with more frequent seizures or poor medication adherence.",
        "Direct costs include expenses related to diagnosis, treatment, and long-term management, such as antiseizure medications and hospitalizations.",
        "A 2021 modeling study estimated the total global cost of epilepsy at approximately $119.27 billion annually, based on per capita cost projections applied to an estimated 52.51 million people living with epilepsy worldwide, while accounting for the treatment gap.",

    "stroke": [
        "Prevention includes decreasing risk factors, surgery to open up the arteries to the brain in those with problematic carotid narrowing, and anticoagulant medication in people with atrial fibrillation.",
        "Aspirin or statins may be recommended by physicians for prevention.",
        "Ischemic strokes, if detected within three to four-and-a-half hours, may be treatable with medication that can break down the clot, while hemorrhagic strokes sometimes benefit from surgery.",
        "Treatment to attempt recovery of lost function is called stroke rehabilitation, and ideally takes place in a stroke unit; however, these are not available in much of the world.",
        "With the availability of treatments that can reduce stroke severity when given early, many now prefer alternative terminology, such as \"brain attack\" and \"acute ischemic cerebrovascular syndrome\" (modeled after heart attack and acute coronary syndrome, respectively), to reflect the urgency of stroke symptoms and the need to act swiftly.",
        "The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery, (2) an embolism originating in the heart, (3) complete blockage of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation).",
        "This causes the endothelial cells of the blood vessels to express adhesion factors which encourages the clotting of blood and formation of thrombus.",
        "Because an embolus arises from elsewhere, local therapy solves the problem only temporarily.",
        "Prompt restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues can reduce or reverse injury, especially if the tissues are not yet irreversibly damaged.",
        "Some causes of hemorrhagic stroke are hypertensive hemorrhage, ruptured aneurysm, ruptured AV fistula, transformation of prior ischemic infarction, and drug-induced bleeding.",
        "The presence of leptomeningeal collateral circulation in the brain is associated with better clinical outcomes after recanalization treatment.",
        "Cerebrovascular reserve capacity is another factor that affects stroke outcome – it is the amount of increase in cerebral blood flow after a purposeful stimulation of blood flow by the physician, such as by giving inhaled carbon dioxide or intravenous acetazolamide.",
        "Giving thrombolytics (clot-busting) in such cases causes intracerebral bleeding 1 to 2% of the time, which is less than that of people with stroke.",
        "Even so, the AHA/ASA guidelines state that starting intravenous tPA in possible mimics is preferred to delaying treatment for additional testing.",
        "Some medical centers have used hyperacute MRI in experimental studies for people initially thought to have a low likelihood of stroke, and in some of these people, stroke has been found which were then treated with thrombolytic medication.",
        "About the use of aspirin as a preventive medication for stroke, in healthy people aspirin does not appear beneficial and thus is not recommended, but in people with high cardiovascular risk, or those who have had a myocardial infarction, it provides some protection against a first stroke.",
        "In those who have previously had stroke, treatment with medications such as aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole may be beneficial.",
        "=== Risk factors === The most important modifiable risk factors for stroke are chronic uncontrolled hypertension and atrial fibrillation, although the size of the effect is small; 833 people have to be treated for 1 year to prevent one stroke.",
        "Nonetheless, given the large body of circumstantial evidence, best medical management for stroke includes advice on diet, exercise, smoking and alcohol use.",
        "Medication is the most common method of stroke prevention; carotid endarterectomy can be a useful surgical method of preventing stroke.",
        "Blood pressure reduction of 10 mmHg systolic or 5 mmHg diastolic reduces the risk of stroke by ~40%.",
        "Lowering blood pressure has been conclusively shown to prevent both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.",
        "Even people older than 80 years and those with isolated systolic hypertension benefit from antihypertensive therapy.",
        "The available evidence does not show large differences in stroke prevention between antihypertensive drugs—therefore, other factors such as protection against other forms of cardiovascular disease and cost should be considered.",
        "The routine use of beta-blockers following stroke or TIA has not been shown to result in benefits.",
        "Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke by about 15%.",
        "Since earlier meta-analyses of other lipid-lowering drugs did not show a decreased risk, statins might exert their effect through mechanisms other than their lipid-lowering effects.",
        "While intensive blood sugar control has been shown to reduce small blood vessel complications such as kidney damage and damage to the retina of the eye it has not been shown to reduce large blood vessel complications such as stroke.",
        "==== Anticoagulant drugs ==== Oral anticoagulants such as warfarin have been the mainstay of stroke prevention for over 50 years.",
        "However, several studies have shown that aspirin and other antiplatelets are highly effective in secondary prevention after stroke or transient ischemic attack.",
        "Low doses of aspirin (for example 75–150 mg) are as effective as high doses but have fewer side effects; the lowest effective dose remains unknown.",
        "Thienopyridines (clopidogrel, ticlopidine) might be slightly more effective than aspirin and have a decreased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding but are more expensive.",
        "Both aspirin and clopidogrel may be useful in the first few weeks after a minor stroke or high-risk TIA.",
        "Dipyridamole can be added to aspirin therapy to provide a small additional benefit, even though headache is a common side effect.",
        "Low-dose aspirin is also effective for stroke prevention after having a myocardial infarction.",
        "Depending on the stroke risk, anticoagulation with medications such as warfarin or aspirin is useful for prevention with various levels of comparative effectiveness depending on the type of treatment used.",
        "Oral anticoagulants, especially Xa (apixaban) and thrombin (dabigatran) inhibitors, have been shown to be superior to warfarin in stroke reduction and have a lower or similar bleeding risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.",
        "Except in people with atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulants are not advised for stroke prevention—any benefit is offset by bleeding risk.",
        "In primary prevention, however, antiplatelet drugs did not reduce the risk of ischemic stroke but increased the risk of major bleeding.",
        "Further studies are needed to investigate a possible protective effect of aspirin against ischemic stroke in women.",
        "==== Surgery ==== Carotid endarterectomy or carotid angioplasty can be used to remove atherosclerotic narrowing of the carotid artery.",
        "Endarterectomy for a significant stenosis has been shown to be useful in preventing further stroke in those who have already had the condition.",
        "Carotid artery stenting has not been shown to be equally useful.",
        "Surgery is most efficient when not delayed too long—the risk of recurrent stroke in a person who has a 50% or greater stenosis is up to 20% after 5 years, but endarterectomy reduces this risk to around 5%.",
        "The number of procedures needed to cure one person was 5 for early surgery (within two weeks after the initial stroke), but 125 if delayed longer than 12 weeks.",
        "Studies of surgical intervention for carotid artery stenosis without symptoms have shown only a small decrease in the risk of stroke.",
        "To be beneficial, the complication rate of the surgery should be kept below 4%.",
        "It does not appear that lowering levels of homocysteine with folic acid affects the risk of stroke.",
        "=== Women === A number of specific recommendations have been made for women including taking aspirin after the 11th week of pregnancy if there is a history of previous chronic high blood pressure and taking blood pressure medications during pregnancy if the blood pressure is greater than 150 mmHg systolic or greater than 100 mmHg diastolic.",
        "In those who have previously had preeclampsia, other risk factors should be treated more aggressively.",
        "=== Previous stroke or TIA === Keeping blood pressure below 140/90 mmHg is recommended.",
        "Among people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, anticoagulation can reduce stroke by 60% while antiplatelet agents can reduce stroke by 20%.",
        "However, a recent meta-analysis suggests harm from anticoagulation started early after an embolic stroke.",
        "Stroke prevention treatment for atrial fibrillation is determined according to the CHA2DS2–VASc score.",
        "The most widely used anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolic stroke in people with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation is the oral agent warfarin while a number of newer agents including dabigatran are alternatives which do not require prothrombin time monitoring.",
        "Anticoagulants, when used following stroke, should not be stopped for dental procedures.",
        "If studies show carotid artery stenosis, and the person has a degree of residual function on the affected side, carotid endarterectomy (surgical removal of the stenosis) may decrease the risk of recurrence if performed rapidly after stroke.",
        "=== Ischemic stroke === Aspirin reduces the overall risk of recurrence by 13% with greater benefit early on.",
        "Definitive therapy within the first few hours is aimed at removing the blockage by breaking the clot down (thrombolysis), or by removing it mechanically (thrombectomy).",
        "Years later, that same idea, that rapid cerebral blood flow restoration results in fewer brain cells dying, has been proved and quantified.",
        "Cerebrolysin, a mixture of pig brain-derived neurotrophic factors used widely to treat acute ischemic stroke in China, Eastern Europe, Russia, post-Soviet countries, and other Asian countries, does not improve outcomes or prevent death and may increase the risk of severe adverse events.",
        "==== Thrombolysis ==== Thrombolysis, such as with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA), in acute ischemic stroke, when given within three hours of symptom onset, results in an overall benefit of 10% with respect to living without disability.",
        "These benefits or lack of benefits occurred regardless of the age of the person treated.",
        "There is no reliable way to determine who will have an intracranial bleed post-treatment versus who will not.",
        "In those with findings of savable tissue on medical imaging between 4.5 hours and 9 hours or who wake up with stroke, alteplase results in some benefit.",
        "Its use is endorsed by the American Heart Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Neurology as the recommended treatment for acute stroke within three hours of onset of symptoms as long as there are no other contraindications (such as abnormal lab values, high blood pressure, or recent surgery).",
        "This position for tPA is based upon the findings of two studies by one group of investigators which showed that tPA improves the chances for a good neurological outcome.",
        "When administered within the first three hours thrombolysis improves functional outcome without affecting mortality.",
        "6.4% of people with large stroke developed substantial brain bleeding as a complication from being given tPA thus part of the reason for increased short term mortality.",
        "In 2013 the American College of Emergency Medicine refuted this position, acknowledging the body of evidence for the use of tPA in ischemic stroke; but debate continues.",
        "Intra-arterial fibrinolysis, where a catheter is passed up an artery into the brain and the medication is injected at the site of thrombosis, has been found to improve outcomes in people with acute ischemic stroke.",
        "==== Endovascular treatment ==== Mechanical removal of the blood clot causing the ischemic stroke, called mechanical thrombectomy, is a potential treatment for occlusion of a large artery, such as the middle cerebral artery.",
        "In 2015, one review demonstrated the safety and efficacy of this procedure if performed within 12 hours of the onset of symptoms.",
        "It did not change the risk of death but did reduce disability compared to the use of intravenous thrombolysis, which is generally used in people evaluated for mechanical thrombectomy.",
        "Certain cases may benefit from thrombectomy up to 24 hours after the onset of symptoms.",
        "==== Craniectomy ==== Stroke affecting large portions of the brain can cause significant brain swelling with secondary brain injury in surrounding tissue.",
        "Relief of the pressure may be attempted with medication, but some require hemicraniectomy, the temporary surgical removal of the skull on one side of the head.",
        "This decreases the risk of death, although some people – who would otherwise have died – survive with disability.",
        "=== Hemorrhagic stroke === People with intracerebral hemorrhage require supportive care, including blood pressure control if required.",
        "People are monitored for changes in the level of consciousness, and their blood sugar and oxygenation are kept at optimum levels.",
        "Anticoagulants and antithrombotics can make bleeding worse and are generally discontinued (and reversed if possible).",
        "A proportion may benefit from neurosurgical intervention to remove the blood and treat the underlying cause, but this depends on the location and the size of the hemorrhage as well as patient-related factors, and ongoing research is being conducted into the question as to which people with intracerebral hemorrhage may benefit.",
        "In subarachnoid hemorrhage, early treatment for underlying cerebral aneurysms may reduce the risk of further hemorrhages.",
        "Depending on the site of the aneurysm this may be by surgery that involves opening the skull or endovascularly (through the blood vessels).",
        "=== Stroke unit === Ideally, people who have had stroke are admitted to a \"stroke unit\", a ward or dedicated area in a hospital staffed by nurses and therapists with experience in stroke treatment.",
        "== Rehabilitation == Stroke rehabilitation is the process by which those with disabling stroke undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living.",
        "It also aims to help the survivor understand and adapt to difficulties, prevent secondary complications, and educate family members to play a supporting role.",
        "The rehabilitation team may involve physicians trained in rehabilitation medicine, neurologists, clinical pharmacists, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologists, and orthotists.",
        "Some teams may also include psychologists and social workers, since at least one-third of affected people manifests post stroke depression.",
        "Daily rehabilitation exercises should continue to be part of the daily routine for people who have had stroke.",
        "Yoga may reduce anxiety and could be included as part of patient-centred stroke rehabilitation.",
        "=== Action observation physical therapy for upper limbs === Low-quality evidence suggests that action observation (a type of physiotherapy that is meant to improve neural plasticity through the mirror-neuronal system) may be of some benefit and has no significant adverse effects, however this benefit may not be clinically significant and further research is suggested.",
        "While there may be an immediate effect after treatment on attention, the findings are based on low to moderate quality and small number of studies.",
        "Further research is needed to assess whether the effect can be sustained in day-to-day tasks requiring attention.",
        "=== Physical and occupational therapy === Physical and occupational therapy have overlapping areas of expertise; however, physical therapy focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions.",
        "Physiotherapists can also work with people who have had stroke to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side.",
        "Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns.",
        "One example physiotherapists employ to promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy.",
        "Through continuous practice the person relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes.",
        "Physical therapy is effective for recovery of function and mobility after stroke.",
        "Occupational therapy is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting.",
        "Approaches to helping people with urinary incontinence include physical therapy, cognitive therapy, and specialized interventions with experienced medical professionals, however, it is not clear how effective these approaches are at improving urinary incontinence following stroke.",
        "Treatment of spasticity related to stroke often involves early mobilizations, commonly performed by a physiotherapist, combined with elongation of spastic muscles and sustained stretching through different positions.",
        "After full range has been achieved by the therapist, the limb should be positioned in the lengthened positions to prevent against further contractures, skin breakdown, and disuse of the limb with the use of splints or other tools to stabilize the joint.",
        "Cold ice wraps or ice packs may briefly relieve spasticity by temporarily reducing neural firing rates.",
        "Electrical stimulation to the antagonist muscles or vibrations has also been used with some success.",
        "Physical therapy is sometimes suggested for people who experience sexual dysfunction following stroke.",
        "==== Interventions for age-related visual problems in patients with stroke ==== With the prevalence of vision problems increasing with age in stroke patients, the overall effect of interventions for age-related visual problems is uncertain.",
        "=== Speech and language therapy === Speech and language therapy is appropriate for people with the speech production disorders: dysarthria and apraxia of speech, aphasia, cognitive-communication impairments, and problems with swallowing.",
        "Speech and language therapy for aphasia following stroke improves functional communication, reading, writing and expressive language.",
        "Speech and language therapy that is higher intensity, higher dose or provided over a long duration of time leads to significantly better functional communication but people might be more likely to drop out of high intensity treatment (up to 15 hours per week).",
        "A total of 20–50 hours of speech and language therapy is necessary for the best recovery.",
        "The most improvement happens when 2–5 hours of therapy is provided each week over 4–5 days.",
        "Speech and language therapy is also effective if it is delivered online through video or by a family member who has been trained by a professional therapist.",
        "Recovery with therapy for aphasia is also dependent on the recency of stroke and the age of the person.",
        "Receiving therapy within a month after the stroke leads to the greatest improvements.",
        "3 or 6 months after the stroke more therapy will be needed but symptoms can still be improved.",
        "People with aphasia who are younger than 55 years are the most likely to improve but people older than 75 years can still get better with therapy.",
        "The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a nasogastric tube may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach.",
        "If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely.",
        "Many mobility problems can be improved by the use of ankle foot orthoses.",
        "Physical exercises as part of a rehabilitation program following stroke appear safe.",
        "=== Other therapy methods === Some current and future therapy methods include the use of virtual reality and video games for rehabilitation.",
        "While virtual reality and interactive video gaming are not more effective than conventional therapy for improving upper limb function, when used in conjunction with usual care these approaches may improve upper limb function and ADL function.",
        "Mirror therapy is associated with improved motor function of the upper extremity in people who have had stroke.",
        "Other non-invasive rehabilitation methods used to augment physical therapy of motor function in people recovering from stroke include neurotherapy as transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct-current stimulation.",
        "Constraint‐induced movement therapy (CIMT), mental practice, mirror therapy, interventions for sensory impairment, virtual reality and a relatively high dose of repetitive task practice may be effective in improving upper limb function.",
        "However, further primary research, specifically of CIMT, mental practice, mirror therapy and virtual reality is needed.",
        "The orthosis supports the therapeutic applications and also helps to mobilize the patient at an early stage.",
        "With the help of an orthosis, physiological standing and walking can be learned again, and late health consequences caused by a wrong gait pattern can be prevented.",
        "A treatment with an orthosis can therefore be used to support the therapy.",
        "A 2016 review reported that these programs improve the quality of life after stroke, without negative effects.",
        "Depression can reduce motivation and worsen outcome, but can be treated with social and family support, psychotherapy and, in severe cases, antidepressants.",
        "Psychotherapy sessions may have a small effect on improving mood and preventing depression after stroke.",
        "Antidepressant medications may be useful for treating depression after stroke but are associated with central nervous system and gastrointestinal adverse events.",
        "Primary among these are pregnancy, childbirth, menopause, and the treatment thereof (HRT).",
        "Martin Luther was described as having an apoplectic stroke that deprived him of his speech shortly before his death in 1546.",
        "== Research == As of 2017, angioplasty and stents were under preliminary clinical research to determine the possible therapeutic advantages of these procedures in comparison to therapy with statins, antithrombotics, or antihypertensive drugs.",
        "Animal models indicate that administration of low-dose amphetamine facilitates behavioural recovery following ischemic stroke, when administered several days after the ischemic event.",
        "This is accompanied by reductions in volumes of tissue lost, increases in fractional anisotropy ratio on the affected side, and increases in BDNF expression, matrix metalloproteinase activity, and expression of synaptophysin."

        "Anemia is the most common blood disorder, affecting about a fifth to a third of the global population.",
        "In more severe anemia, the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing cardiac output.",

        "Hematocrit; however, is concentration dependent and is therefore not completely accurate.",
        "Reticulocyte counts, and the \"kinetic\" approach to anemia, have become more common than in the past in the large medical centers of the United States and some other wealthy nations, in part because some automatic counters now have the capacity to include reticulocyte counts.",
        "The following is a simplified schematic of this approach: * For instance, sickle cell anemia with superimposed iron deficiency; chronic gastric bleeding with B12 and folate deficiency; and other instances of anemia with more than one cause.",
        "Increased iron intake is also needed to offset blood losses due to digestive tract issues, frequent blood donations, or heavy menstrual periods.",
        "Therefore, one must always be aware of anemia following this procedure.",
        "Drugs such as methotrexate, zidovudine, and other substances may inhibit DNA replication such as heavy metals Macrocytic anemia can be further divided into \"megaloblastic anemia\" or \"nonmegaloblastic macrocytic anemia\".",
        "The treatment for vitamin B12-deficient anemia was first devised by William Murphy, who bled dogs to make them anemic, and then fed them various substances to see what (if anything) would make them healthy again.",
        "He discovered that ingesting large amounts of liver seemed to cure the disease.",
        "George Minot and George Whipple then set about to isolate the curative substance chemically and ultimately were able to isolate the vitamin B12 from the liver.",
        "For example, a person recently transfused for iron deficiency would have small, pale, iron deficient red blood cells (RBCs) and the donor RBCs of normal size and color.",
        "Similarly, a person transfused for severe folate or vitamin B12 deficiency would have two cell populations, but, in this case, the patient's RBCs would be larger and paler than the donor's RBCs. A person with sideroblastic anemia (a defect in heme synthesis, commonly caused by alcoholism, but also drugs/toxins, nutritional deficiencies, a few acquired and rare congenital diseases) can have a dimorphic smear from the sideroblastic anemia alone.",

        "== Treatment == The global market for anemia treatments is estimated at more than USD 23 billion per year and is fast growing because of the rising prevalence and awareness of anemia.",
        "The types of anemia treated with drugs are iron-deficiency anemia, thalassemia, aplastic anemia, hemolytic anemia, sickle cell anemia, and pernicious anemia, the most important of them being deficiency and sickle cell anemia with together 60% of market share because of highest prevalence as well as higher treatment costs compared with other types.",
        "Vitamin supplements given orally (folic acid or vitamin B12) or intramuscularly (vitamin B12) will replace specific deficiencies.",
        "Apart from that, iron supplements, antibiotics, immunosuppressant, bone marrow stimulants, corticosteroids, gene therapy and iron chelating agents are forms of anemia treatment drugs, with immunosuppressants and corticosteroids accounting for 58% of the market share.",
        "A paradigm shift towards gene therapy and monoclonal antibody therapies is observed.",
        "Mild to moderate iron-deficiency anemia is treated by oral iron supplementation with ferrous sulfate, ferrous fumarate, or ferrous gluconate.",
        "Daily iron supplements have been shown to be effective in reducing anemia in women of childbearing age.",
        "The stomach upset can be alleviated by taking the iron with food; however, this decreases the amount of iron absorbed.",
        "Vitamin C aids in the body's ability to absorb iron, so taking oral iron supplements with orange juice is of benefit.",
        "In the anemia of chronic kidney disease, recombinant erythropoietin or epoetin alfa is recommended to stimulate RBC production, and if iron deficiency and inflammation are also present, concurrent parenteral iron is also recommended.",
        "=== Injectable iron === In cases where oral iron has either proven ineffective, would be too slow (for example, pre-operatively), or where absorption is impeded (for example in cases of inflammation), parenteral iron preparations can be used.",
        "Parenteral iron can improve iron stores rapidly and is also effective for treating people with postpartum haemorrhage, inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic heart failure.",
        "In many cases, the patient has a deficit of over 1,000 mg of iron which would require several months to replace.",

        "=== Vitamin B12 intramuscular injections === In many cases, vitamin B12 is used by intramuscular injection in severe cases or cases of malabsorption of dietary-B12.",
        "Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is usually easily treated by providing the necessary level of vitamin B12 supplementation.",
        "The injections are quick-acting, and symptoms usually go away within one to two weeks.",
        "As the condition improves, doses are reduced to weeks and then can be given monthly.",

        "Levothyroxine is the mainstay of treatment for people with hypothyroidism, while people with hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease can be managed with iodine therapy, antithyroid medication, or surgical removal of the thyroid gland.",
        "Thyroid surgery may also be performed to remove a thyroid nodule or to reduce the size of a goiter if it obstructs nearby structures or for cosmetic reasons.",
        "The main hyperthyroid conditions are: Graves' disease Toxic thyroid nodule Thyroid storm Toxic nodular struma (Plummer's disease) Hashitoxicosis: transient hyperthyroidism that can occur in Hashimoto's thyroiditis === Structural abnormalities === Goiter: an abnormal enlargement of the thyroid gland Endemic goiter Diffuse goiter Multinodular goiter Lingual thyroid Thyroglossal duct cyst === Tumors === Thyroid cancer Papillary Follicular Medullary Anaplastic Lymphomas are usually malignant Thyroid adenomas are benign tumors === Medication side effects === Certain medications can have the unintended side effect of affecting thyroid function.",
        "While some medications can lead to significant hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and those at risk will need to be carefully monitored, some medications may affect thyroid hormone lab tests without causing any symptoms or clinical changes, and may not require treatment.",
        "The following medications have been linked to various forms of thyroid disease: Amiodarone (more commonly can lead to hypothyroidism, but can be associated with some types of hyperthyroidism) Lithium salts (hypothyroidism) Some types of interferon and IL-2 (thyroiditis) Glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, and somatostatin analogs (block TSH, which can lead to hypothyroidism) == Pathophysiology == Most thyroid disease in the United States stems from a condition where the body's immune system attacks itself.",
        "This causes the receptor to activate even without TSH being present and causes the thyroid to produce and release excess thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism).",
        "The main reason this happens is because of increased signaling to the thyroid by way of TSH receptors to try to make it produce more thyroid hormone.",
        "In hypothyroid states or iodine deficiency, the body recognizes that it is not producing enough thyroid hormone and starts to produce more TSH to help stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormone.",
        "This stimulation causes the gland to increase in size to increase production of thyroid hormone.",
        "In more rare cases, the thyroid may become enlarged because it becomes filled with thyroid hormone or thyroid hormone precursors that it is unable to release or because of congential abnormalities or because of increased intake of iodine from supplementation or medication.",
        "One of the major changes to help with the development of the fetus is the production of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).",
        "When hypothyroidism is seen in pregnancy, it is often because an individual already has hypothyroidism and needs to increase their levothyroxine dose to account for the increased thyroxine binding globulin present in pregnancy.",
        "Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is another important hormone that is secreted by the anterior pituitary cells in the brain.",
        "Its primary function is to increase the production of T3 and T4 by the thyroid gland.",
        "Free T3 and T4 measurements are important because certain drugs and illnesses can affect the concentrations of transport proteins, resulting in differing total and free thyroid hormone levels.",
        "Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is injected into the body through a vein.",
        "Large amounts of externally administered TRH can suppress the subsequent release of TSH.",
        "This amount of release-suppression is exaggerated in primary hypothyroidism, major depression, cocaine dependence, amphetamine dependence and chronic phencyclidine abuse.",
        "Radioiodine collects in the thyroid gland before being excreted in the urine.",
        "A normal quantitation of radioiodine uptake demonstrates that about 8-35% of the administered dose can be detected in the thyroid 24 hours later.",
        "Fine needle aspiration has the advantage of being a brief, safe, outpatient procedure that is safer and less expensive than surgery and does not leave a visible scar.",
        "== Treatment == === Medication === Levothyroxine is a stereoisomer of thyroxine (T4) which is degraded much more slowly and can be administered once daily in patients with hypothyroidism.",
        "Natural thyroid hormone from pigs is sometimes also used, especially for people who cannot tolerate the synthetic version.",
        "Hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease may be treated with the thioamide drugs propylthiouracil, carbimazole or methimazole, or rarely with Lugol's solution.",
        "Additionally, hyperthyroidism and thyroid tumors may be treated with radioactive iodine.",
        "Ethanol injections for the treatment of recurrent thyroid cysts and metastatic thyroid cancer in lymph nodes can also be an alternative to surgery.",
        "=== Surgery === Thyroid surgery is performed for a variety of reasons.",
        "A large majority of the thyroid may be removed (subtotal thyroidectomy) to treat the hyperthyroidism of Graves' disease, or to remove a goiter that is unsightly or impinges on vital structures.",
        "A complete thyroidectomy of the entire thyroid, including associated lymph nodes, is the preferred treatment for thyroid cancer.",
        "Removal of the bulk of the thyroid gland usually produces hypothyroidism unless the person takes thyroid hormone replacement.",
        "Consequently, individuals who have undergone a total thyroidectomy are typically placed on thyroid hormone replacement (e.g. levothyroxine) for the remainder of their lives.",
        "Higher than normal doses are often administered to prevent recurrence.",
        "Removal results in hypoparathyroidism and a need for supplemental calcium and vitamin D each day.",
        "A 2019 systematic review concluded that the available evidence shows no difference between visually identifying the nerve or utilizing intraoperative neuroimaging during surgery, when trying to prevent injury to recurrent laryngeal nerve during thyroid surgery.",
        "=== Radioiodine === Radioiodine therapy with iodine-131 can be used to shrink the thyroid gland (for instance, in the case of large goiters that cause symptoms but do not harbor cancer—after evaluation and biopsy of suspicious nodules has been done), or to destroy hyperactive thyroid cells (for example, in cases of thyroid cancer).",
        "To enhance iodine-131 uptake by the thyroid and allow for more successful treatment, TSH is raised prior to therapy in order to stimulate the existing thyroid cells.",
        "This is done either by withdrawal of thyroid hormone medication or injections of recombinant human TSH (Thyrogen), released in the United States in 1999.",
        "Radioiodine treatment can also cause hypothyroidism (which is sometimes the end goal of treatment) and, although rare, a pain syndrome (due to radiation thyroiditis).",

        "=== Antibiotics === Most sinusitis cases are caused by viruses and resolve without antibiotics.",
        "However, if symptoms do not resolve within 10 days, either amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate are reasonable antibiotics for first treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate being slightly superior to amoxicillin alone but with more side effects.",
